Confidence Bounds for the Poulation Mean When σ is Known
=============================================================

Confidence intervals provide two boundaries that define a plausible range for the true parameter. 
When the **practical interest lies primarily in one direction**, however, 
**one-sided confidence bounds** offer a more context-appropriate and precise approach. 
Their logic and derivation follow the same principles as those of two-sided intervals, 
but they differ in how the probability of error is allocated.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important
   
   * **Recognize the situations** in which using a one-sided confidence bound may
     be more precise and cost-efficient than a confidence interval.
   * **Derive a confidence bound** using principles parallel to those used in constructing confidence intervals,
     and apply the result to practice.

Why One‑Sided Bounds?
-----------------------

Two-sided confidence intervals aim to capture the unknown population mean :math:`\mu` on both sides of the point estimator 
:math:`\bar{X}`. However, many scientific questions call 
for a **directional guarantee**. For example:

* In certain safety assessemnts, the mean toxin level must **not exceed** a legal limit.
* The average tensile strength must be **at least** a promised specification to pass a quality control test.
* A component's mean time to failure must be **greater than** a minimum benchmark.
* A drug's efficacy must be **above** a specified threshold.

In these situations, a one-sided confidence bound is not only more directly aligned with the research question 
but also provides a **more precise** bound than the interval at the same confidence level.

Deriving the Upper Confidence Bound
-------------------------------------

The Goal
~~~~~~~~~~

For an **upper** confidence bound, we are only concerned with the guarantee that
the population mean :math:`\mu` is **below** a certain threshold. That is,
for a pre-specified confidence coefficient :math:`C` between 0 and 1, we would like to 
find an upper bound of the form :math:`\bar{X} + ME` such that

.. math::
   P\left(\mu < \bar{X} + ME \right) = C.

Preliminaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The language used in deriving confidence bounds overlaps significantly with
that of confidence intervals.

* The probability :math:`C` is called the **confidence coefficient** and its conversion
  to percentage is called the **confidence level**.
* :math:`\alpha = 1 - C`. 
* A :math:`z`-**critical value** :math:`z_\alpha` marks the location on the standard normal pdf 
  whose upper area is :math:`\alpha`.

   :alt: Standard normal curve displaying one-sided critical region
   :figwidth: 90%
   :align: center

Note that :math:`z_\alpha` also satisfies :math:`P(Z < z_\alpha) = C`.

The Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The assumptions required for validity of the construction is identical to the two-sided case:

1. :math:`X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n` form an *iid* sample from the population, :math:`X`.
   The expected value and variance of :math:`X` is denoted :math:`\mu` and :math:`\sigma^2`,
   respectively.
2. Either the population is normally distributed, or we have sufficiently large :math:`n`
   for the CLT to hold.
3. The population variance :math:`\sigma^2` is known.

It follows that the pivotal quantity has the standard normal distribution:

.. math::
   \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1).

The Derivation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We begin with the property of :math:`z_\alpha` which holds by its definition:

.. math::
   P(Z < z_\alpha) = C.

1. Replace :math:`Z` with the pivotal quanity:

   .. math::
      P\left(\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} < z_{\alpha}\right) = C

2. Multiply both sides by :math:`\sigma/\sqrt{n}`:

   .. math::
      P\left(\bar{X}-\mu < z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = C

3. Subtract :math:`\bar{X}` from both sides and multiply by -1 (which reverses the inequality):

   .. math::
      P\left(\mu < \bar{X} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = C

This gives us a probability statement with the same structure as our goal.


.. admonition:: Derive the lower confidence bound as an independent exercise 🤔
   :class: important 

   For lower confidence bounds, we are looking for a guarantee that the population
   mean :math:`\mu` is **above** a threshold with a high probability :math:`C`.
   Since it bounds :math:`\mu` from below, it will take the general form :math:`\bar{X}-ME`.
   Follow the same flow of logic under the same assumptions, making sure to reflect
   the change in direction.

Summary
~~~~~~~~~~

The **upper confidence bound (UCB)** for an observed mean (lower case :math:`\bar{x}`) is: 

.. math::
      \bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

The **lower confidence bound (LCB)** for an observed mean is: 

.. math::
   \bar{x} - z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

.. admonition:: An Interval Representation of Confidence Bounds
   :class: important

   Confidence bounds are sometimes represented as *intervals* with one endpoint extending to infinity.
   The respective interval representations of upper and lower confidence bounds are:

   .. math::
      \left(-\infty, \quad \bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right]
      \quad \text{and} \quad
      \left[\bar{x} - z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\quad \infty\right)


.. admonition:: Example💡: Lead Content in Drinking Water
   :class: note

   An environmental agency samples :math:`n = 40` water taps in a neighborhood. Laboratory analysis 
   reports a sample mean lead concentration of :math:`\bar{x} = 12.7` ppb (parts per billion). 
   Historical data suggest the population standard deviation is :math:`\sigma = 4.5` ppb. The Environmental 
   Protection Agency (EPA) action level for lead in drinking water is :math:`15` ppb.

   Using 95% confidence level, construct the appropriate confidence region to answer the question: 
   "Is the mean lead level in this neighborhood safely below the 
   EPA action limit?" 

   **Which confidence region is appropriate?**

   The goal is to establish an **upper boundary** which marks a safe zone for the true mean
   lead concentration level. We will construct a 95% upper confidence bound.

   **The building blocks**

   * :math:`\sigma = 4.5`
   * :math:`n=40`
   * :math:`\alpha = 1-C = 0.05`
   
   **Step 1:** Compute the critical value
   
   .. math::
      z_{0.05} = 1.645

   This result can be obtained by running ``qnorm(0.05, lower.tail=FALSE)`` on R.

   **Step 2:** Calculate the margin of error

   .. math::
      \text{ME} = z_{0.05} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.645 \frac{4.5}{\sqrt{40}} \approx 1.17 \text{ ppb}

   **Step 3:** Determine the upper bound

   .. math::
      \text{UCB} = \bar{x} + \text{ME} = 12.7 + 1.17 = 13.87 \text{ ppb}

   **Interpretation:** We are 95% confident that the true mean lead level in the neighborhood 
   is below 13.87 ppb, which is less than the EPA action limit of 15 ppb. 
   This provides statistical evidence that the neighborhood's water supply is in 
   compliance with EPA standards.

Comparison of Confidence Intervals and Bounds
------------------------------------------------

It is important to note that a confidence bound **does not coincide** with either 
endpoint of the confidence interval at the same confidence level. The table below summarizes
the key differences:

.. flat-table::
   :width: 100%
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 
     - Confidence Interval
     - Confidence Bound
  
   * - **Critical value**
     - :math:`z_{\alpha/2}`
     - :math:`z_\alpha`

   * - **Margin of error**
     - :math:`z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}`
     - :math:`z_{\alpha}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}`
   
   * - **Size of ME**
     - Always greater than CB
     - Always smaller than CI

The size difference in the MEs arises naturally from the definitions of their critical values.
:math:`z_\alpha` must leave out an area twice as large as :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` in the
upper region of the standard normal pdf. Therefore, it must locate itself closer to 0, resulting in a smaller
value than :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` (:numref:`comparing-cv`).

.. _comparing-cv:

   :figwidth: 70%
   :align: center 
   :alt: Comparison of alpha and alpha/2 critical values on a standard normal pdf

   Comparison of critical values for :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\alpha/2`

The table below compares the computed values of :math:`z_\alpha` and :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` for several
commonly used :math:`C= 1-\alpha`:

.. flat-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Confidence Level
     - One-sided :math:`z_{\alpha}`
     - Two-sided :math:`z_{\alpha/2}`

   * - 90%
     - 1.282
     - 1.645

   * - 95%
     - 1.645
     - 1.960

   * - 99%
     - 2.326
     - 2.576

This means that under identical experimental conditions (:math:`C, \sigma`, and :math:`n`), a confidence bound
will always provide a more precise result than a confidence interval on the side of interest. 
By concentrating the available 
resources on a single side rather than splitting them between both bounds, a confidence bound 
achieves greater efficiency whenever applicable.

Choosing Between Bounds and Intervals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The choice between a one-sided bound and a two-sided interval should be made **based on the scientific 
question**, not on which approach gives more favorable results. You may use the guidelines below.

* **Match the research question**: Use one-sided bounds when the research question naturally has a 
  directional component.
  
* **Avoid post-hoc selection**: Make the decision before collecting or analyzing any data.
  Choosing the most favorable confidence region after evaluating all 
  possible candidates undermines the validity of the stated confidence level.

Bringing It All Together
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   * **One-sided confidence bounds** are appropriate when the research question involves a 
     directional concern about a parameter.
   * An **upper confidence bound (UCB)** :math:`\bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` 
     provides a value that the parameter likely falls below.
   * A **lower confidence bound (LCB)** :math:`\bar{x} - z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` 
     provides a value that the parameter likely exceeds.
   * One-sided bounds use **different critical values** from two-sided intervals at the same 
     confidence level.
   * The type of confidence region must be chosen to align with the research question, 
     before collecting and analyzing the data.

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A battery manufacturer wants to ensure that the mean battery life exceeds :math:`40` hours. 
   A sample of :math:`25` batteries has a mean life of :math:`42.3` hours. 
   Assuming :math:`\sigma = 5` hours is known 
   from extensive testing, construct an appropriate 95% confidence region for the mean battery life
   and formally interpret the reuslt. Does this provide evidence that the mean exceeds :math:`40` hours?

2. Environmental regulations require that the mean concentration of a pollutant in factory 
   discharge not exceed :math:`3.5` ppm. A random sample of :math:`36` discharge measurements yields 
   :math:`\bar{x} = 3.2` ppm. If :math:`\sigma = 0.8` ppm, construct an appropriate 99% confidence region
   and formally interpret the result. Does the factory appear to be in compliance?
