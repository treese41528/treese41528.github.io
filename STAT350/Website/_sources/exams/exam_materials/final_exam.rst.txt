.. admonition:: Final Exam Procedures
   :class: important

   **Exam overview and timing**

   - The final exam is a **comprehensive two-hour assessment** (exactly **120 minutes**).
   - It covers the full scope of the course, with an approximate emphasis of:
     
     - **Post-Exam 2 material:** ~60%
     - **Early-course material:** ~40%
     
   - You may **fill out the front page before the exam starts**.
   - During the exam, **write your name on every odd numbered page**. This **cannot** be done after time is called.

   **Exam format**

   - The exam begins with objective questions:
     
     - Approximately **5–10 True or False** questions, **2 points each**
     - Approximately **4–10 Multiple Choice** questions, **3 points each**
     
     These questions will mix post-Exam 2 and earlier material.

   - The remaining questions are **free response**.
   - Unless stated otherwise, report **numeric answers to four decimal places**.

   **Graphs, work requirements, and interpretation**

   - If graphs are needed, they will be **provided**, except you may be asked to **draw or complete a modified boxplot**.
   - All provided graphs will be **labeled appropriately**.
   - It is acceptable to use graphics to support your answers when appropriate.
   - Any numbers you use that are **not provided** in the question (and not computed in a prior part) must have **supporting work shown**.
   - A **correct answer without work is considered incorrect**.

   **Code recognition**

   - You will **not** be required to write code.
   - You **will** be required to **recognize code and interpret output**.

   **Allowed materials**

   - **Two** 8.5 × 11 inch crib sheets are allowed.
     
     - You may use **both sides** of both pages.
     - They may be **typed or handwritten**.
     - You may include anything you want.
     - Strong recommendation: organize for quick lookup (for example, headings, boxed sections, and color coding for formulas, definitions, theorems, and techniques).

   - A **scientific calculator** is required.
   - A **z table is not needed**. Any critical values or quantiles you need will be available from **code output**.

   **Desk policy and personal belongings**

   - The only items allowed on your desk are:
     
     - crib sheets
     - writing utensils and erasers
     - scientific calculator
     - picture ID
     
   - All other personal belongings must be stored away (backpack, purse, etc.).
   - Once the exam begins, you may **not** open your bag unless given permission by your instructor.
   - If you need scratch paper, raise your hand and it will be provided.
     
     - Write your name in the **upper right corner** of all scratch paper.
     
   - Your phone must be stored away and cannot be at your desk.
   - You may not share anything with anyone else in the room.

   **Submitting the exam**

   - Turn in your exam at the location assigned by your instructor.
   - You must show your **PUID** (or another ID with instructor permission) and **sign the attendance sheet** for your section indicating you took the exam.

   **Grading policy: consistency across parts**

   We grade on **consistency**, meaning your work on earlier parts affects how later parts are graded.

   - **Positive impact (partial credit through consistency):**
     
     - If a later part depends on an earlier computed value, we will grade the later part **using your earlier answer**, even if the earlier answer was incorrect.
     - This can allow you to earn full credit on later parts if your work is consistent.

     *Example:* If Part (a) asks for a normalization constant and Part (b) uses that constant to compute a probability, Part (b) can receive full credit if it is computed correctly **using your Part (a) value**.

     Important: If you are unsure on an early part, write something **plausible** so later parts can still be graded. However, an **impossible** value (for example, one that would make a density negative or identically zero) will reduce credit on dependent parts.

   - **Negative impact (loss of points for inconsistency):**
     
     - If you set up the problem one way and later proceed in a way that conflicts with your earlier setup, you can lose points even if the later computation is otherwise correct.

     *Example:* If you state a **two-sided** alternative hypothesis (≠) and later compute a **one-sided** confidence bound instead of a two-sided confidence interval, you will lose points for inconsistency with your earlier setup.
