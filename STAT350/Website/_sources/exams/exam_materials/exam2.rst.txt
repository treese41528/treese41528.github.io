   :class: important

   **Duration and timing**

   - The exam is **exactly 60 minutes** long.
   - You may **fill out the front page before the exam starts**.
   - During the exam, **write your name on every odd numbered page**. This **cannot** be done after time is called.

   **Breaks and leaving the room**

   - **No breaks** are allowed during the exam.
   - If you leave the exam room, you must **turn in your exam** and you **cannot return**.

   **Exam format**

   - The exam begins with:
     
     - **1–6 True or False** questions, **2 points each**
     - **1–6 Multiple Choice** questions, **3 points each**
     
   - The remaining questions are **free response**.
   - Unless stated otherwise, report **numeric answers to four decimal places**.

   **Graphs, work, and interpretation**

   - If graphs are needed, they will be **provided**, except possibly a **modified boxplot**.
   - Graphs will be **labeled** so you know what they are for.
   - You may use the provided graphics to answer questions. However, any numbers you use that are **not given** in the question (and not computed in earlier parts) must have **supporting work shown**.

   **Code recognition**

   - You will **not** be required to write code, but you **will** be required to **recognize code and interpret output**.

   **Allowed materials**

   - **One** 8.5 × 11 inch crib sheet is allowed.
     
     - You may use **both sides**.
     - It may be **typed or handwritten**.
     - You may include anything you want.
     - Strong recommendation: organize it for fast lookup (for example, boxes, headings, color coding for formulas, definitions, theorems, and techniques).

   - A **scientific calculator** is required.

   - A **z table is not needed** for this exam. Any critical values or quantiles you need will be available from **code output**.

   **Desk policy and personal belongings**

   - The only items allowed on your desk are:
     
     - writing utensils and erasers
     - scientific calculator
     - picture ID
     
   - All other personal belongings must be stored away (backpack, purse, etc.).
   - Once the exam begins, you may **not** open your bag unless given permission by the instructor.
   - If you need scratch paper, raise your hand and it will be provided.
     
     - Write your name in the **upper right corner** of all scratch paper.
     
   - Your phone must be stored away and cannot be at your desk.
   - You may not share anything with anyone else in the room.

   **Submitting the exam**

   - Turn in your exam at the location assigned by your instructor.
   - You must show your **PUID** (or another ID with instructor permission) and **sign the attendance sheet** for your section.
   - You must turn in **all papers**, including:
     
     - the exam
     - any scratch paper
     
     (Note: a z table is not required for Exam 2.)

   **Grading policy**

   - Grading emphasizes **consistency across parts**.
   - If a later part depends on an earlier result, we will grade the later part **based on your earlier answer**, even if the earlier answer was incorrect.
   - If you do not know how to do an earlier part, write something **plausible** so dependent parts can still be graded.
   - If you write an **impossible value** (for example, a normalization constant that makes a PDF negative or identically 0), you will lose points on dependent parts.

   **Returning exams**

   - Exams will be returned via **Gradescope**. Details will be provided later.
