Conditional Probability
===================================

With the foundations of probability established, we can now extend our toolset to explore **how events 
influence each other**. In real-world scenarios, we often have partial information about an experiment's outcome, 
and need to update our probability assessments as more information is gathered. 
Conditional probability provides the mathematical 
framework for incorporating this new information and analyzing relationships between events.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   • Define conditional probability and understand its interpretation.
   • Derive the conditional probability formula and the general multiplication rule.
   • Understand how tree diagrams represent conditional probabilities graphically.

Understanding Conditional Probability
---------------------------------------

**Conditional probability** addresses how the probability of one event changes when we know 
that another event has occurred. It represents the revised probability assessment for an event 
based on new information.

For example, if an AI model is trying to detect wolves in an image, knowing that the image contains 
large carnivores increases the probability that the image contains wolves. The additional information 
about large carnivores changes, or **conditions**, the probability assessment for wolves.

Definition and Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conditional probability of event A given that event B has occurred is denoted by P(A|B), 
read as "the probability of A given B."

The conditional probability is computed as

.. math::

   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.

This formula is valid only when P(B) > 0 (we cannot condition on impossible events).

What is happening in the conditional probability formula?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A probability, whether conditional or not, represents the relative size of 
a part out of a whole.

In non-conditional situations, the relative size of event A is assessed out of the whole sample space.

   Non-conditional probability

However, by knowing that event B occurs, **our sample space becomes restricted to only the outcomes in B**
-anything that does not belong to B is not a potential outcome anymore. Within this reduced sample space, we're interested in the relative size of the regoin which belongs to event A.

   Conditional probability

..
   The Set Minus Operation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In conditional probability discussions, we often use the **set minus** operation, 
   denoted by A\\B (read as "A minus B"). This represents all elements that are in set A but not in set B.

   .. math::

      A \setminus B = A \cap B'

   This operation allows us to precisely describe parts of sets that don't overlap, 
   which is useful in probability calculations.

.. admonition:: Example: Cards from a Deck
   :class: note

   Suppse we are drawing a card from a standard deck with 52 cards. 
   Define H as the event of drawing a heart and Q as the event of drawing a queen.

   .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/standard-deck.png
      :alt: A standard 52-card deck
      :align: center
      :figwidth: 80%

      A standard 52-card deck

   1. A card has been drawn. If it is known that the card is a heart, what is the probability
      that it is a queen?

      * :math:`P(Q ∩ H) = 1/52` (only one card is both a queen and a heart)
      * :math:`P(H) = 13/52 = 1/4` (there are thirteen hearts)

      .. math:: P(Q|H) = \frac{P(Q ∩ H)}{P(H)} = \frac{1/52}{13/52} = \frac{1}{13}.

   2. If it is known that the card is a queen, what is the probability
      that it is a heart?

      :math:`P(Q) = 4/52 = 1/13` (there are four queens). Therefore,

      .. math:: P(H|Q) = \frac{P(Q ∩ H)}{P(Q)} = \frac{1/52}{1/13} = \frac{1}{4}.
      

The General Multiplication Rule
---------------------------------------

The conditional probability formula can be rearranged to give us the **general multiplication rule**:

.. math::

   P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)

This rule allows us to find the probability of the intersection of two events when we know a 
conditional probability and an unconditional probability.

The formula can also be written as:

.. math::

   P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)

Both forms are valid, and which one to use depends on what information is available in a given problem.

.. admonition:: Extending the general multiplication rule to multiple events
   :class: important 

   1. Begin by taking an unconditoined probability of any one event.
   2. Multiply the probabiity of a new event **conditional** on the event used for step 1.
   3. Multiply the probability of another new event **conditional** on the intersection
      of all previously used events.
   4. Continue in a similar manner.

   For three events A, B, and C, there are six different ways to apply the multiplication rule:

   .. math::

      P(A \cap B \cap C) &= P(A) \times P(B|A) \times P(C|A \cap B) \\
      P(A \cap B \cap C) &= P(A) \times P(C|A) \times P(B|A \cap C) \\
      P(A \cap B \cap C) &= P(B) \times P(A|B) \times P(C|A \cap B) \\
      &\vdots

Tree Diagrams
--------------

**Tree diagrams** provide a visual tool for organizing and calculating probabilities 
in **multi-stage experiments**, especially when conditional probabilities are involved. 

Constructing a Tree Diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/tree-general.png
   :alt: A general tree diagram
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 50%

   A general tree diagram; the superscript :math:`^c` is another notation for complement.

A tree diagram is constructed using the following rules:

A. Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The different stages are organized into **vertical layers**. The first
  vertical layer describes all events that happen during the first stage.
  The second layer describe all events that happen in the second stage, and
  the process is repeated if there are more than two stages.

B. Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^

  Each node represents an event **conditional on all previous nodes**. Since
  the first layer does not have any previous node, this is the only layer
  which involves unconditional events.

C. Branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  The set of branches stemming from a single node must cover *all* scenarios that can happen
  given the previous path of nodes.
  On each branch leading to a node, we wirte the *conditional* probability of the node.  

Why is a tree diagram convenient?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* It provides a comprehensive picture of an experiment with many components.
* It allows us to **view the general multiplication rule graphically**, since
  the probability of a path can be computed by multiplying all the
  conditional probabilities along the path.

  In a two-layer tree diagram, for example, :math:`P(A' \cap B')` can be computed by

   .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/intersection-prob-tree.png

      Computing a path probability using a tree diagram

Tree diagrams will also play a crucial role in illustrating important concepts
such as the law of total probability in the following sections.

.. admonition:: Example :Drawing a tree diagram

   Glen and Jia are going to Indianapolis for one day this weekend. 
   They are twice as likely to go on Sunday as they are on Friday, and three times 
   as likely to go on Saturday as they are on Friday. There is a 45% chance of rain on Friday, 
   a 25% chance of rain on Saturday, and a 30% chance of rain on Sunday.

   1. Draw a complete tree diagram to represent this situation.

      Let's define our notation:

      - Fri, Sat, Sun = events representing which day they go to Indianapolis
      - R = "it rains during their trip"
      - R' = "it does not rain during their trip"

      .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/full-tree-indy.png
         :alt: The tree diagram for the Indianapolis problem
         :align: right
         :figwidth: 30%

      **Step 1**: First, we need to find the unknown probabilities.

      Given that they are twice as likely to go on Sunday as on Friday, and three times as likely 
      to go on Saturday as on Friday, we can write:

      .. math::

         P(Sun) = 2P(Fri) \hspace{0.2cm}\text{ and }\hspace{0.2cm} P(Sat) = 3P(Fri).

      Since they will go on exactly one of the three days:

      .. math::

         1 &= P(Fri) + P(Sat) + P(Sun) \\
           &= P(Fri) + 3P(Fri) + 2P(Fri) = 6P(Fri)\\

      Therefore, :math:`P(Fri) = 1/6`, and

      .. math::

         P(Sat) = 3P(Fri) = 1/2 \hspace{0.2cm}\text{ and }\hspace{0.2cm} P(Sun) = 2P(Fri) = 1/3.
         
      **Step 2**: We know the conditional probabilities from the weather forecasts.

      .. math::

         P(R|Fri) &= 0.45 \\
         P(R|Sat) &= 0.25 \\
         P(R|Sun) &= 0.30

      Using the complement rule, we can also find:

      .. math::

         P(R'|Fri) = 1 - P(R|Fri)&= 0.55 \\
         P(R'|Sat) = 1 - P(R|Sat)&= 0.75 \\
         P(R'|Sun) = 1 - P(R|Sun)&= 0.70

   2. Find the probability that they go to Indianapolis on Sunday **and**
      it does not rain.
   
      .. math::

         P(R' \cap Sun) = P(Sun)P(R'|Sun) = (1/3)(0.70) = 7/30.

Bringing It All Together 
-----------------------------
.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **Conditional probability** P(A|B) represents the probability of event A occurring, 
      given that event B occurs, and is calculated as P(A ∩ B)/P(B).
   
   2. When we condition on an event B, we effectively restrict our sample space 
      to only the outcomes in B, creating a new probability measure within this reduced space.
   
   3. The **general multiplication rule** P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) × P(B) allows us to find
      the probability of intersections using conditional probabilities.
   
   4. **Tree diagrams** provide a systematic way to organize and calculate probabilities 
      in multi-stage experiments, with the probability of each path found by multiplying 
      conditional probabilities along branches.
   
   5. When solving conditional probability problems, clearly define the events, identify what is known, 
      and determine what needs to be calculated before applying the appropriate formulas.
