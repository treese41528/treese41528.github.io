Measures of Variability - Interquartile Range and Five-Number Summary
==========================================================================

While the sample variance and standard deviation provide useful measures of spread, they can be heavily 
influenced by extreme values. In situations where data is skewed or contains unusual observations, 
we need measures that are less sensitive to individual points. 
This is where the interquartile range (IQR) and five-number summary come into play‚Äîmeasures that 
focus only on the middle portion of the data.

Preliminaries: Percentiles and Quartiles
----------------------------------------------

Sample Percentiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a number :math:`p` between 0 and 100, the :math:`p`-th **sample percentile** of a variable is the 
value such that :math:`p\%` of observations are less than or equal to that value. For example:

* The 10th percentile is a value such that 10% of all observations are less than or equal to it.
* The 99th percentile is a value such that 99% of all observations are less than or equal to it.

Sample Quartiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Sample quartiles** are three special percentiles which divide
the data into four equally sized parts, each containing approximately 25% of the data points. They consist of

* :math:`Q_1` **(first quartile)**: The 25th percentile
* :math:`Q_2` **(second quartile)**: The 50th percentile. This is also the sample median.
* :math:`Q_3` **(third quartile)**: The 75th percentile

   *A distribution divided into four equal parts by the quartiles*

Calculating Sample Quartiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample quartiles can be found by "computing three different medians." The specific steps are as follows:

1. Compute the sample median of the whole data set. This is the second quartile, or :math:`Q_2`.
2. The data is now divided into two equally sized subsets, from the minimum to the median,
   then from the median to the maximum. Include
   the median in both subsets if it is **on** a data point.
   Compute the sample median of the first subset. This is the first quartile, :math:`Q_1`, for the whole data.
3. Likewise, compute the median for the second subset. This is the third quartile, :math:`Q_3`, for the whole data.


.. admonition:: Example üí°: Computing the Sample Quartiles

        - 100
        - 150
        -

   **Calculating the sample quartiles by hand**

   1. :math:`n=19`. The sample median of the data set is the 10th smallest value. :math:`Q_2 = 24`.
   2. Let us now consider the first half of the data, from 7 to 24. There are 10 (even) data points in the
      subset. Therefore, we take the average between the 5th and the 6th data points as the subset's sample median.
      :math:`Q_1 = \frac{14+18}{2} = 16`.
   3. Repeating Step 2 for the second subset (24 to 150), we find :math:`Q_3 = \frac{37+47}{2} = 42`.

   Confirm that the four sections created by :math:`Q_1, Q_2` and :math:`Q_3` are equally sized.

   **Calculating the sample quartiles in R**
   
   In R, the `quantile()` function is used to calculate percentiles (quantiles are simply percentiles on a 0-1 scale instead of
   0-100.) By default, it returns the **five-number summary** (minimum, Q‚ÇÅ, median, Q‚ÇÉ, maximum):

   .. code-block:: r

      # Example dataset
      x <- c(7, 12, 14, 14, 14, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 34, 34, 37, 47, 49, 64, 100, 150)
      
      # Get quartiles (five-number summary)
      quantile(x)
      
      # Output:
      #    0%   25%   50%   75%  100% 
      #   7.0  16.0  24.0  42.0 150.0

   To access  quartiles, you can use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: r

      # Get Q1 (25th percentile)
      quantile(x)["25%"]
      
      # Get Q3 (75th percentile)
      quantile(x)["75%"]

   You can also request specific percentiles other than the default:

   .. code-block:: r

      # Calculate the 10th, 20th, 30th percentiles
      quantile(x, probs = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3))

The Interquartile Range (IQR)
--------------------------------

The **interquartile range (IQR)** represents the spread of the data using **the width 
of the middle 50%**. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (:math:`Q_3`) 
and the first quartile (:math:`Q_1`):

.. math::

   \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1.

..
   Properties of IQR
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is resistant to values at the extreme ends since it focuses only on the middle 50% of the data.

.. admonition:: Example  üí°: Calculating the IQR
   :class: note

   For the *number of months to promotion* data, compute the IQR.
   
   From the previous example, :math:`Q_3 = 42` and :math:`Q_1 = 16`. Then
   
   .. math::

      \text{IQR} = 42 - 16 = 26.

   This tells us that the middle 50% of the data spans 26 months, giving us a sense of how spread out the
   *typical* cases are.

   R provides a built-in function to calculate the IQR.

   .. code-block:: r

      # Calculate IQR
      IQR(x)
      
      # Alternative calculation
      q <- quantile(x)
      q["75%"] - q["25%"]

Five-Number Summary
---------------------

The **five-number summary** provides a concise overview of a dataset's distribution by reporting 
the sample quartiles, together with the data's minimum and maximum.
This summary gives a **comprehensive picture of the center** (:math:`Q_2`), 
**spread** (:math:`Q_1` and :math:`Q_3`), **and extremes** (min and max) of the data. 

See the first code block of **Example üí°: Computing the Sample Quartiles**
for an instance of a five-number summary.

Identifying Explicit Points with Fences
-----------------------------------------

One important application of the IQR is to identify potential outliers or 
**explicit points** in the data. We use what's called the **IQR rules** to establish
"fences" beyond which observations are flagged for further inspection.

* **Inner fences** are computed using the **1.5 IQR rule**: 

   * Lower inner fence = :math:`Q_1 - 1.5 IQR`
   * Upper inner fence = :math:`Q_3 + 1.5 IQR`

* **Outer fences** are computed using the **3 IQR rule**: 

   * Lower outer fence = :math:`Q_1 - 3 IQR`
   * Upper outer fence = :math:`Q_3 + 3 IQR`

Points that fall between the inner and outer fences are considered **mild explicit points**, 
while those beyond the outer fences are considered **extreme explicit points**.

.. admonition:: Example üí°: Identifying the Explicit Points
   :class: note 
   
   For the *number of months to promotion* data, identify the inner and outer fences,
   and identify any mild and extreme explicit points.

   .. flat-table::
      :align: center
      :width: 100%
   
      * - 7
        - 12
        - 14
        - 14
        - 14
        - 18
        - 21
        - 22
        - 23
        - 24

      * - 25
        - 34
        - 34
        - 37
        - 47
        - 49
        - 64
        - 100
        - 150
        -

   From the previous exmaple, IQR = 26.

   * Lower inner fence: :math:`16 - (1.5)(26) = -23`
   * Upper inner fence: :math:`42 + (1.5)(26) = 81`
   * Lower outer fence: :math:`16 - (3)(26) = -62`
   * Upper outer fence: :math:`42 + (3)(26) = 120`

   Since the value 100 exceeds the upper inner fence (81) but falls below the upper outer fence (120),
   it is classified as a mild explicit point. The value 150 exceeds the upper outer fence (120), making 
   it an extreme explicit point. There are no lower explicit points in the data.

Modified Box Plots
--------------------

A **modified box plot** is a visual representation of 
**the five-number summary** and the explicit points identified by the **1.5 IQR** rule.
It consists of

1. A **box** that spans from Q‚ÇÅ to Q‚ÇÉ, representing the middle 50% of the data,
2. A **line** inside the box marking the median (Q‚ÇÇ),
3. **Whiskers** extending from the box to the most extreme data points **that are not classified as explicit points**, and
4. **Explicit points** as dots beyond the whiskers.

.. _box-plot:

   A modified box plot with labeled components

The dot inside the box represents the sample mean of the data. While it is not a formal component of
a box plot, we often include it for a more comprehensive view of the data distribution.

.. admonition:: Why do we call it *modified*?
   :class: important

   The box plots introduced in this course are a modified version of the basic form,
   which does not account for explicit points. You are not expected to know or use the basic version.
   Whenever we refer to a box plot, we always mean the modified version.

.. admonition:: Example üí°: Creating a Modified Box Plot
   :class: note

   For the *number of months to promotion* data set, draw a modified box plot both by hand
   and using R. Then interpret the data's distribution.
   
   **Drawing a modified box plot by hand**

   #. Draw a horizontal or vertical axis that covers the full range of the data.
   #. Draw a line thruough Q‚ÇÅ and Q‚ÇÉ and draw a box which uses them as its two sides.
   #. Draw a line across the box at the median (Q‚ÇÇ).
   #. Draw whiskers from the box to the most extreme data points that are NOT beyond the inner fences.
   #. Plot individual points for observations beyond the inner fences.

   **Drawing a modified box plot using R**

   .. code-block:: r
      
      # Import the graphing package
      library(ggplot2)

      # Create data vector 
      promotion <- c(7, 12, 14, 14, 14, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 34, 34, 37, 47, 49, 64, 100, 150)

      # Change format to data frame
      promotion_df <- data.frame(months=promotion)

      # Graph
      ggplot(pro_df, aes(y="", x=months)) +  # flip x and y to make the plot vertical
         stat_boxplot(geom="errorbar") + #formats the whiskers
         geom_boxplot() + 
         ggtitle("Boxplot of Months to Promotion") +
         stat_summary(fun = mean, col = "black", geom = "point", size = 3) 


   The code above returns :numref:`box-plot`. 

Reading box plots beyond the five number summary
----------------------------------------------------

Skewness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While box plots offer a less detailed view of the data distribution than histograms, 
they are effective for quickly identifying skewness. Let us 
compare the histograms and the box plots drawn for the same data sets:

.. _skewed-box-plots:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter3/box_plot_vs_histogram.png
   :alt: Comparison of histograms and box plots
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 100%

   Histograms and box plots of skewed data sets

Recall that each of the four sections defined by the sample quartiles contains approximately 
the same number of data points. Therefore, if one whisker is much longer than the box or 
the other whisker, it suggests that the data is more spread out in that section of the distribution.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Box plots are efficient for identifying symmetry or skewness, but
they are limited in the level of detail they provide on the shape of the distribution. 
Most importantly, we **cannot**

* determine whether the data is normal (bell-shaped), or
* identify the number of modes in the data

through a box plot. See the examples below‚Äîeach with a distinct distribution, 
yet producing very similar box plots.

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter3/symmetric-box-plots.png
   :alt: Box plots of different symmetric distributions
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 100%

   Box plots of different symmetric distributions

To gain a detailed understanding of the **shape** of the data distribution, we must 
use more refined graphical tools such as histograms.

Explicit Points vs. Real Outliers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When interpreting a modified box plot, it's crucial to understand
that **not all explicit points are real outliers**.

* **Explicit points** are observations flagged by statistical criteria like the 1.5 IQR rule. 
  They are points that mathematically deviate from the pattern established by the majority of the data.

* **Real outliers** are explicit points that, upon investigation, truly deviate from the underlying 
  pattern of the data. They may represent errors, anomalies, or genuinely unusual cases.


When a data distribution is strongly skewed,
for example, values on the longer tail may be identified as explicit points by the 1.5 IQR rule,
although they are simply conforming to the underlying distribution. See :numref:`skewed-box-plots`.

When a data point is flagged as explicit, it should be inspected more carefully 
to determine if:

#. it represents an error in measurement, recording, or data entry,
#. it is an observation from a different population or process,
#. or **very far** from the main body of the box plot 
   to be considered part of the same distribution.

In these cases, the explicit points are considered true outliers.

.. admonition:: Exampleüí°: Interpreting a box plot

   Interpret the box plot of teh *number of months to promotion* data.
   
   .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter3/box-plot-unlabeled.png
      :alt: Box plot of months to promotion data
      :align: center
      :figwidth: 60%

   * The middle 50% of engineers were promoted between 16 and 42 months after hiring.
   * The median time to promotion was 24 months.
   * Two engineers (100 and 150 months) are identified as explicit points.
   * Since the right half of the data is more spread out than the left half
     (longer right whisker, greater distance between Q2 and Q3 than Q1 and Q2),
     the data set is right-skewed.

   The two explicit points are very far from the main body of the plot with
   gaps larger than the IQR itself, so we must investigate the possibility of them being real outliers. 
   They might represent engineers who:

   * Were hired with specialized skills not requiring management roles.
   * Chose to remain in technical roles longer.
   * Faced unusual circumstances affecting their promotion timeline.
   * Were erroneously included in the dataset.

   

..
   Choosing Between Spread Measures
   ---------------------------------

   When deciding whether to use standard deviation or IQR as your primary measure of spread, consider:

   * Use **standard deviation** when:
   * Data is approximately normally distributed
   * There are no significant outliers
   * You need to perform calculations that specifically require standard deviation

   * Use **interquartile range** when:
   * Data is skewed
   * There are potential outliers
   * You want a robust measure that isn't heavily influenced by extreme values

   In practice, it's often valuable to report both measures, as they provide complementary information about the spread of your data.

Bringing It All Together
--------------------------
