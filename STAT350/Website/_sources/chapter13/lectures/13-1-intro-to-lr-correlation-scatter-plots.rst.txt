Introduction to Linear Regression
=========================================================================

So far, we have studied inference methods that describe a single population or the relationship 
between a quantitative variable and a categorical variable.
Regression analysis, in contrast, examines relationships between **two quantitative variables**. 
While many core statistical ideas parallel the methods from previous chapters, one major shift occurs—we can now describe the
relationship using a **functional form**, represented by a trendline.

After a brief introduction to general regression analysis, we narrow our focus to variables
that exhibit a **linear associations**.

.. admonition:: Road Map
   :class: important

   * Express the core ideas of previous inference methods in model form.
   * Build the general regression model for two quantitative variables. 
     Understand its components and see how it extends the modeling ideas from earlier methods.
   * Graphically assess the association of two quantitative variables using scatter plots.


The Evolution of Our Statistical Journey
---------------------------------------------

Before diving into linear regression, let us reflect on our journey through statistical
inference. Each major phase has built systematically toward the culminating topic of linear regression.

Model for Single Population Inference 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We began with the fundamental problem of inferring an unknown population mean :math:`\mu` from 
sample data. The corresponding model can be written as:

.. math::

   X_i = \mu + \varepsilon_i,

where :math:`\varepsilon_i` represent *iid* errors with :math:`E(\varepsilon_i)=0` and 
:math:`\text{Var}(\varepsilon_i) = \sigma^2` for :math:`i = 1, 2, \ldots, n`. 
This model captures the essential idea that each observation consists of an underlying mean plus random 
variation around that mean.

Two-Population Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A. Independent Two-Sample Inference**


We then extended our methods to comparison of two population means, handling both independent and 
dependent sampling scenarios.

For independent two-sample inference, the assumptions can be expressed using
the model:

.. math::
   &X_{Ai} = \mu_A + \varepsilon_{Ai} \\ 
   &X_{Bi} = \mu_B + \varepsilon_{Bi},

where

* :math:`\mu_A` and :math:`\mu_B` are the unknown population means,
* :math:`\varepsilon_{Ai}` are *iid* with :math:`E(\varepsilon_{Ai})=0` and :math:`\text{Var}(\varepsilon_{Ai}) = \sigma^2_A` 
  for all :math:`i=1,\cdots,n_A`,
* :math:`\varepsilon_{Bi}` are *iid* with :math:`E(\varepsilon_{Bi})=0` and :math:`\text{Var}(\varepsilon_{Bi}) = \sigma^2_B` 
  for all :math:`i=1,\cdots,n_B`, and
* error terms of Population A are independent from error terms of Population B.

**B. Paired Two-Sample Inference**

For paired samples, the difference is modeled directly:

.. math::

   D_i = X_{Ai} - X_{Bi} = (\mu_A - \mu_B) + \varepsilon_i

where :math:`\varepsilon_i` are *iid* with :math:`E(\varepsilon_i)=0` and :math:`\text{Var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2_D`.

The ANOVA Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ANOVA extended the modeling ideas for the independent two-sample analysis to  :math:`k`-samples. Each 
observation :math:`X_{ij}` is assumed to satisfy:

.. math::

   X_{ij} = \mu_i + \varepsilon_{ij},

where 

* :math:`\mu_i` is the true mean for group :math:`i`, and
* :math:`\varepsilon_{ij}` are *iid* errors with :math:`E(\varepsilon_{ij})=0` and :math:`\text{Var}(\varepsilon_{ij}) = \sigma^2`
  for all possible pairs :math:`(i,j)`.

----------------------------------------

The Regression Framework
--------------------------------------

Throughout our progression, we consistently worked with a **single quantitative variable**—either on its own
or in connection with a **categorical factor variable** that divides data into groups.

In regression analyses, we study the relationship of **two quantitative variables**. Because both variables carry
numerical order and magnitude, our interest expands: 
we now examine not only whether an association exists but also the **functional form** that characterizes how the two variables relate.

The General Regression Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our new modeling framework can be expressed as:

.. math::

   Y = g(X) + \varepsilon.

This simple equation contains profound ideas:

* The **response variable** :math:`Y` (also called the **dependent variable**) represents the outcome to be understood and predicted.

* The **explanatory variable** :math:`X` (also called the **independent variable**) represents the variable that may explain,
  influence, or predict changes in the response variable.

* The **regression function** :math:`g(X)` defines the systematic relationship between the explanatory and response variables. 
  This function captures the *average* behavior of how :math:`Y` changes with :math:`X`.

* The error rerm :math:`\varepsilon` represents **unexplained variation**—everything about :math:`Y` that cannot be explained 
  by the functional relationship with :math:`X`.

.. admonition:: Functional Association Does Not Guarantee Causality
   :class: danger

   Two variables are said to be **associated** if changes in one variable are accompanied by systematic changes in the other variable. 
   
   **Causation** makes a stronger claim that one variable brings about changes in the other. 
   Establishing causation requires careful experimental design and advanced analytical techniques that allow the
   causal argument to be statistically rigorous.

   ‼️ Regression analyses covered in this course **can establish association, but not causation.**

Preliminary Assessment of Linear Relationship Through Scatter Plots
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before mathematically constructing regression analysis, let us examine the association between 
two quantitative variables graphically. Scatter plots are the primary tool for this stage.

The Anatomy of a Scatter Plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _scatter-intro:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter13/scatter-intro.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center 
   :alt: Scatter plot

   An example of a scatter plot


A scatter plot consists of: 

- **Horizontal X-axis** whose range includes all :math:`x_i` values in the data set
- **Vertical Y-axis** whose range includes all observed :math:`y_i` values
- **Points** at coordinates :math:`(x_i, y_i)`, each representing an observed pair

The assessment of a scatter plot consists of three main steps: 

* **Step 1:** Check whether there is any relationship between the two variables, and if yes, identify the form of 
  the relationship (linear, curved, etc.). 
 
Once the relationship is confirmed to be linear, proceed to:

* **Step 2:** Assess the direction and strength of the linear relationship.
* **Step 3:** Check if any horizontal or vertical ouliers exist.

Step 1: The Functional Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During this stage, we visualize a curve which best summarizes the trend created by the data points.
Depending on its functional form, we classify the association as linear, exponential, polynonomial, 
clustered, etc. :numref:`scatter-intro` shows a scatter plot with a linear trend.

See :numref:`scatter-plot-forms` for scatter plots exhibiting trends of different functional forms.

.. _scatter-plot-forms:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter13/scatter-form.png
   :width: 95%
   :align: center
   :alt: Scatter plots showing different functional forms

   Scatter plots showing trends with exponential, polynomial, and sinusoidal forms

Other possible forms are: 

- **Threshold or breakpoint patterns**: The relationship changes character at certain values, requiring 
  different functional forms in different regions.
- **Clustered form**: Points group into distinct clusters rather than following a smooth pattern. This suggests 
  the presence of subgroups or categories within the data.
- **No pattern**: Points appear randomly scattered with no discernible relationship. This suggests that the 
  explanatory variable provides little or no information about the response variable.


Step 2: Direction and Strength of a Linear Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a linear form is identified, we characterize the association further with its **direction** 
and **strength**. 

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter13/scatter-direction.png
   :width: 95%
   :align: center
   :alt: Scatter plots with varying directions of linear association

   Scatter plots with different directions of linear association

**Positive linear association** is indicated by an **upward trend** in the scatter plot.
As the explanatory variable :math:`X` increases, the response variable :math:`Y` tends to increase as well.

**Negative linear association** is indicated by a **downward trend**, with the variables moving in "opposite" directions.

.. _scatter-plot-strength:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter13/scatter-strength.png
   :width: 95%
   :align: center
   :alt: Scatter plots with varying strengths of linear association

   Strength of linear association increases from left to right


**Strength** of a linear relationship is indicated on a scatter plot by how closely the points gather around the 
best-fit line. We say that :math:`X` and :math:`Y` have a deterministic (perfect) linear association when 
the data points lie on a straight line (first on the right of :numref:`scatter-plot-strength`).

.. admonition:: Exception: A Perfect Horizontal Line
   :class: important

   When the summary line is horizontal, we consider the two random variables to be **unassociated**, even if 
   the dots draw a perfect line. This may seem contradictory to our prior discussion at first, but recall that two variables 
   are associated if information of one variable gives us **extra** information about the other. 
   In an association described by a flat line, the knowledge of an :math:`X` value gives no
   additional information on the potential location of :math:`Y`.

Step 3: Outliers and Influential Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two types of outliers in regression analysis:

* :math:`X`-outliers deviate horizontally **from other** :math:`X` **values** (:numref:`x-outliers`).
* :math:`Y`-outliers show a greater vertical **distance from the trendline** than other data points (:numref:`y-outlier`). 

Note the key distinction: :math:`Y`-outliers are determined by their distance from the
associational trend with :math:`X`, not from other :math:`Y` values.

.. _y-outlier:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter13/y-outlier.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center
   :alt: Y-outlier

   Y-outlier is circled in red

We further define an **influential point** as an observation that has a large impact on the fitted 
regression line. Removing this point would substantially change the slope, the intercept, or both.
We also say that such points have **high leverage**.

.. _x-outliers:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter13/x-outliers.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center
   :alt: X-outliers

   X-outliers

In :numref:`y-outlier` and :numref:`x-outliers`, the red trend lines summarize all 
data points, while the blue trend lines summarize the data with outliers removed. These graphs
provide important takeaways:

* It is problematic if few outliers have high leverage, as they distort the *general* trend.
* Between the two types, :math:`X`-outliers are generally more influential than :math:`Y`-outliers,
  often "pulling" the best fit line toward them. 
* Not all outliers are influential, and not all influential points are outliers. 

.. admonition:: Example💡: Car Engine Performance 🚘
   :class: note

   Automotive engineers collected data on eight four-cylinder vehicles that are considered to be among the most fuel-efficient in 2006. 
   For each vehicle, they measured:

   - The total displacement of the engine, in cylinder volume (liters)
   - The power output of the engine, in orsepower (hp)

        - Toyota Yaris
        - 1.5
        - 106


   **Q1: Which variable should be explanatory and which should be response?**

   From an engineering perspective, the physical size of the engine largely determines its potential power output. 
   Larger engines generally have the capacity to produce more power, though other factors like engine design and tuning also matter. Therefore,
   we use cylindar volume as the explanatory variable :math:`X` and the power output as the respones :math:`Y`.

   **Q2: Create a Scatter Plot**

   1. Save the data set in the ``data.frame`` format:

   .. code-block:: r

      car_efficiency <- data.frame(
      hp = c(100, 96, 115, 150, 126, 150, 118, 106),
      cylinder_volume = c(1.8, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 1.8, 2.5, 1.6, 1.5)
      )
   
   2. Use ``ggplot`` to make a scatter plot with a fitted line:

   .. code-block:: r

      ggplot(car_efficiency, aes(x = cylinder_volume, y = hp)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", size = 1) +
      labs(
         title = "2006 Fuel Efficiency",
         x = "Cylinder Volume (L)",
         y = "Horsepower (hp)"
      ) +
      theme_minimal()

   The resulting plot is:

      :width: 80%
      :align: center 
      :alt: Scatter plot of car engine performance data set

      Scatter plot of car engine performance data set

   **Q3: Identify the form of the relationship between the total displacement and the power output.**

   The points roughly follow a linear pattern. We don't see curvature, clustering, or other non-linear patterns.

   **Q4: If the form is linear, state the direction and strength of the linear relationship. Are there any outliers? If there are, are the outliers influential?**

   * The linear association is positive—as the cylinder volume increases, the power output tends to increase. 
   * The strength is moderate—most points cluster reasonably close to the apparent trend line, though there is some scatter. 
   * There are no obvious outliers or influential points. All data points fall within reasonable ranges in both directions 
     and follow the general pattern.

Bringing It All Together
-------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **The regression model** :math:`Y = g(X) + \varepsilon` decomposes observations into systematic relationships plus unexplained 
      variation.

   2. Most regression analyses can **only establish association**; causation requires well-designed experiments and advanced 
      analysis methods.

   3. **Scatter plots are the primary tool** for assessing form, direction, and strength of bivariate 
      relationships.

   4. There are **two types of outliers** in regression analysis. :math:`X`-outliers lie far from most
      :math:`X` values. 
      :math:`Y`-outliers lie far from the trend line of their association with :math:`X`. 
      
   5. **Outliers and influential points require special attention** because they can dramatically affect fitted 
      models and conclusions. :math:`X`-outliers are more prone to being influential than :math:`Y`-outliers.

Exercises
---------

.. admonition:: Exercise 1: Identifying Variables in Regression
   :class: note

   A mechanical engineer is studying the relationship between the rotational speed of a CNC lathe (in RPM) and the surface roughness of machined aluminum parts (in micrometers, μm). The engineer collects data by measuring surface roughness on parts that were machined at various speeds during normal production (an **observational study**).

   a. Identify the explanatory variable and the response variable. Justify your choice.

   b. Write the general regression model :math:`Y = g(X) + \varepsilon` for this scenario, clearly defining each component.

   c. Given that this is an observational study, why can't we conclude that rotational speed *causes* changes in surface roughness from a regression analysis alone?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Variable Identification**

      - **Explanatory variable:** Rotational speed (RPM) — this is the variable we believe may influence the outcome
      - **Response variable:** Surface roughness (μm) — this is what the engineer measures as an outcome

      The choice is based on engineering logic: we hypothesize that machine settings (speed) influence surface quality. Note that in this observational study, the engineer does not control or assign speeds—they simply record what speeds were used during normal production.

      **Part (b): Regression Model**

      :math:`Y = g(X) + \varepsilon` where:

      - :math:`Y` = Surface roughness (μm)
      - :math:`X` = Rotational speed (RPM)
      - :math:`g(X)` = The true functional relationship between speed and roughness
      - :math:`\varepsilon` = Random error (unexplained variation in surface roughness)

      **Part (c): Causation**

      Because this is an **observational study**, regression can only establish *association*, not *causation*. To establish causation, we would need:

      - A controlled experiment with random assignment of speeds to parts
      - Control of confounding variables (e.g., cutting tool condition, material batch, operator)
      - Temporal precedence established

      In observational data, confounding variables may simultaneously affect both speed choice and roughness outcome (e.g., experienced operators may choose different speeds AND achieve better surface finish).

   a. Describe the form of the relationship (linear, curved, or no pattern).

   b. Describe the direction of the association (positive, negative, or none).

   c. Describe the strength of the association (strong, moderate, or weak).

   d. Are there any potential outliers or influential points? If so, describe them.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Form**

      Linear — the points follow an approximately straight-line pattern.

      **Part (b): Direction**

      Positive — as screen brightness increases, discharge rate increases.

      **Part (c): Strength**

      Strong — points cluster closely around the trend line with relatively little scatter.

      **Part (d): Outliers/Influential Points**

      No obvious outliers or influential points. All observations follow the general pattern consistently.

.. admonition:: Exercise 4: Correlation Coefficient Interpretation
   :class: note

   For each scenario below, determine whether the sample correlation coefficient :math:`r` would likely be positive, negative, or close to zero:

   a. CPU temperature (°C) and processor utilization (%)

   b. Code review time (hours) and number of bugs found in deployment

   c. Distance from router (meters) and WiFi download speed (Mbps)

   d. Shoe size and programming ability among software engineers

   e. Altitude (feet) and atmospheric pressure (psi)

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): CPU temp vs. utilization**

      **Positive** — higher utilization generates more heat, increasing CPU temperature.

      **Part (b): Code review time vs. bugs**

      **Negative** — more thorough code reviews (longer time) catch more bugs before deployment, reducing bugs found later.

      **Part (c): Distance from router vs. download speed**

      **Negative** — download speed decreases as distance from the router increases due to signal attenuation.

      **Part (d): Shoe size vs. programming ability**

      **Close to zero** — there is no logical connection between shoe size and programming ability.

      **Part (e): Altitude vs. pressure**

      **Negative** — atmospheric pressure decreases at higher altitudes.

      :align: center

      Six scatter plots to match with correlations

   The following correlation coefficients were calculated for six different datasets:

   :math:`r = 0.92`, :math:`r = -0.75`, :math:`r = 0.35`, :math:`r = -0.98`, :math:`r = 0.02`, :math:`r = 0.65`

   Match each scatter plot (1-6) with its corresponding correlation coefficient. Briefly justify each match.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Matching (based on visual inspection of direction and scatter):

      - **Plot 1:** :math:`r = 0.92` — strong positive linear relationship with tight clustering
      - **Plot 2:** :math:`r = -0.75` — negative relationship with moderate spread
      - **Plot 3:** :math:`r = 0.35` — weak positive relationship with large scatter
      - **Plot 4:** :math:`r = -0.98` — nearly perfect negative linear relationship
      - **Plot 5:** :math:`r = 0.02` — essentially no linear relationship (random scatter)
      - **Plot 6:** :math:`r = 0.65` — moderate positive relationship

      **Justification:**

      - The sign of :math:`r` indicates direction (positive = upward trend, negative = downward trend)
      - The magnitude |r| indicates strength (closer to 1 = tighter clustering around the line)

   a. Point A has coordinates (2100, 1.08). Is this an X-outlier, Y-outlier, both, or neither? Explain.

   b. Point B has coordinates (1450, 1.22). Is this an X-outlier, Y-outlier, both, or neither? Explain.

   c. Which point (A or B) is likely to be more influential on the fitted regression line? Justify your answer.

   d. What would you recommend the engineer do before fitting a regression model?

      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Point A (2100, 1.08)**

      **X-outlier** — the X-value (2100 PSI) is far from other X values (mostly 1200-1800). The Y-value appears consistent with what the trend would predict at that X, so it's not a Y-outlier.

      **Part (b): Point B (1450, 1.22)**

      **Y-outlier** — the X-value is typical (within the normal range), but the Y-value (1.22) is much higher than what the trend line would predict for that X value.

      **Part (c): Which is more influential?**

      **Point A is more influential.** X-outliers have high leverage because they can "pull" the regression line toward them. Point A, being isolated in the X-direction, has more power to change the slope and intercept of the fitted line than Point B, which only affects the fit locally.

      **Part (d): Recommendations**

      - Investigate the data collection for both points (measurement error? Different conditions?)
      - Fit the regression with and without each point to assess impact on slope and R²
      - Check if outliers represent legitimate data or errors
      - Consider robust regression methods if outliers are legitimate but influential

.. admonition:: Exercise 7: Computing Sample Correlation
   :class: note

   A biomedical engineer is studying the relationship between ultrasound frequency (MHz) and tissue penetration depth (cm) for a new imaging device. The following data were collected:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20

      * - Frequency (X)
        - Depth (Y)
      * - 2.0
        - 15.2
      * - 3.5
        - 10.8
      * - 5.0
        - 7.5
      * - 7.5
        - 4.9
      * - 10.0
        - 3.2

   Given the following summary statistics:

   - :math:`\bar{x} = 5.6`, :math:`\bar{y} = 8.32`
   - :math:`S_{XX} = \sum_{i=1}^{5}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 40.7`
   - :math:`S_{YY} = \sum_{i=1}^{5}(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = 92.068`
   - :math:`S_{XY} = \sum_{i=1}^{5}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = -58.51`

   a. Calculate the sample correlation coefficient :math:`r`.

   b. Interpret the value of :math:`r` in context (direction and strength).

   c. Based on your calculated :math:`r`, is simple linear regression appropriate for this data? Explain.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Calculate r**

      .. math::

         r = \frac{S_{XY}}{\sqrt{S_{XX} \cdot S_{YY}}} = \frac{-58.51}{\sqrt{40.7 \times 92.068}} = \frac{-58.51}{\sqrt{3747.17}} = \frac{-58.51}{61.214} = -0.956

      **Part (b): Interpretation**

      There is a **very strong negative** linear relationship between ultrasound frequency and tissue penetration depth. As frequency increases, penetration depth decreases substantially.

      The strength is "very strong" because :math:`|r| = 0.956 > 0.8`.

      **Part (c): Appropriateness of SLR**

      **Yes**, simple linear regression is appropriate. The correlation magnitude (:math:`|r| = 0.956`) indicates a very strong linear relationship, suggesting that a linear model will fit the data well.

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         x <- c(2.0, 3.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0)
         y <- c(15.2, 10.8, 7.5, 4.9, 3.2)
         cor(x, y)  # -0.9558

      Scatter plot with quadratic pattern

   A dataset has sample correlation :math:`r = 0.05`. The scatter plot of the data is shown above.

   a. Does the near-zero correlation mean there is no relationship between X and Y? Explain.

   b. What type of relationship appears to exist between X and Y?

   c. Why does the correlation coefficient fail to capture this relationship?

   d. What type of transformation or alternative analysis would you recommend?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Does r ≈ 0 mean no relationship?**

      **No.** A near-zero correlation only means there is no *linear* relationship. There can still be a strong *non-linear* relationship, as evident in the scatter plot.

      **Part (b): Type of relationship**

      The scatter plot shows a **quadratic (parabolic)** relationship — Y increases with X, reaches a maximum, then decreases. This is an inverted U-shape.

      **Part (c): Why correlation fails**

      Correlation measures the strength of *linear* association only. For this symmetric curved pattern:

      - Points on the left show a positive trend
      - Points on the right show a negative trend
      - These cancel out, producing :math:`r \approx 0`

      The correlation coefficient is simply not designed to detect non-linear patterns.

      **Part (d): Recommendations**

      - Fit a quadratic model: :math:`Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \varepsilon` (polynomial regression)
      - Transform variables appropriately (e.g., :math:`X^2` as a predictor)
      - Consider piecewise regression
      - Note: Polynomial regression is covered in later courses, but recognizing when it's needed is important

.. admonition:: Exercise 9: Conceptual Understanding
   :class: note

   Consider the following statements about correlation and regression. For each, indicate whether it is TRUE or FALSE and provide a brief justification.

   a. If :math:`r = 1`, then all data points lie exactly on a line with positive slope.

   b. A correlation of :math:`r = -0.8` indicates a weaker relationship than :math:`r = 0.6`.

   c. The correlation coefficient is affected by the units of measurement.

   d. If two variables have correlation :math:`r = 0.9`, then changes in X cause changes in Y.

   e. Swapping which variable is X and which is Y changes the value of :math:`r`.

   f. A single outlier can dramatically change the correlation coefficient.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): r = 1 means all points on a line with positive slope**

      **TRUE.** When :math:`r = 1`, there is a perfect positive linear relationship, meaning all points lie exactly on a line with positive slope.

      **Part (b): r = −0.8 is weaker than r = 0.6**

      **FALSE.** Strength is measured by :math:`|r|`. Since :math:`|-0.8| = 0.8 > 0.6 = |0.6|`, the correlation :math:`r = -0.8` indicates a *stronger* relationship than :math:`r = 0.6`.

      **Part (c): Correlation depends on units**

      **FALSE.** Correlation is unitless—changing units (e.g., meters to feet, or Celsius to Fahrenheit) does not change :math:`r` because it's based on standardized values.

      **Part (d): r = 0.9 implies causation**

      **FALSE.** Correlation measures association, not causation. Strong correlation does not imply that X causes Y. There may be confounding variables, reverse causation, or coincidental association.

      **Part (e): Swapping X and Y changes r**

      **FALSE.** Correlation is symmetric: :math:`r(X,Y) = r(Y,X)`. The formula is symmetric in X and Y.

      **Part (f): A single outlier can dramatically change r**

      **TRUE.** A single outlier, especially an X-outlier with high leverage, can dramatically increase or decrease the correlation coefficient. This is why checking for outliers before computing correlation is important.

Additional Practice Problems
----------------------------

**Quick Calculations**

1. A study finds :math:`r = 0.75` between study time and exam score. Calculate :math:`R^2` and interpret.

2. If :math:`S_{XX} = 100`, :math:`S_{YY} = 400`, and :math:`S_{XY} = -150`, calculate :math:`r`.

3. Data shows :math:`r = -0.45`. What percentage of variation in Y is explained by X?

**True/False**

4. If :math:`r = 0`, the variables are independent.

5. Adding a constant to all Y values changes the correlation.

6. The correlation between height in inches and height in centimeters is :math:`r = 1`.

.. dropdown:: Answers to Practice Problems
   :class-container: sd-border-success

   **Quick Calculations:**

   1. :math:`R^2 = r^2 = 0.75^2 = 0.5625 = 56.25\%`. About 56% of the variation in exam scores is explained by study time.

   2. :math:`r = \frac{S_{XY}}{\sqrt{S_{XX} \cdot S_{YY}}} = \frac{-150}{\sqrt{100 \times 400}} = \frac{-150}{200} = -0.75`

   3. :math:`R^2 = (-0.45)^2 = 0.2025 = 20.25\%` of variation is explained.

   **True/False:**

   4. **FALSE** — Zero correlation means no *linear* relationship. Variables could have a strong non-linear relationship and still be dependent.

   5. **FALSE** — Adding a constant shifts all values equally and doesn't change the correlation (it's based on deviations from means).

   6. **TRUE** — Height in inches and height in centimeters are perfectly linearly related (cm = 2.54 × inches), so :math:`r = 1`.
