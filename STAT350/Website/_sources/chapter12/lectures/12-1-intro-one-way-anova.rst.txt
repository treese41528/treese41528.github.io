Introduction to One-Way ANOVA
==========================================================

Our journey through statistical inference has taken us from single populations to comparisons between 
two populations. We've developed powerful tools for estimating parameters and testing hypotheses when 
we have one or two groups. However, many important research questions involve comparing three or more 
populations simultaneously. When we want to determine if there are differences among multiple groups, 
we need a new approach that can handle the complexity of simultaneous comparisons while controlling our 
overall error rates.

   :class: important

   • **Problem we will solve** – How to compare the means of three or more populations simultaneously 
   while controlling Type I error rates
   • **Tools we'll learn** – One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), F-distributions, and the fundamental 
   concept of variance decomposition
   • **How it fits** – This extends our two-sample procedures to multi-group scenarios, introducing methods 
   that form the foundation for experimental design and regression analysis


From Two Groups to Many: The Need for ANOVA
----------------------------------------------

The statistical procedures we've developed for comparing two population means work beautifully when we have exactly two groups to compare. But what happens when our research questions involve three, four, or even more populations? Consider these scenarios:

**Multiple Treatment Comparisons**

A pharmaceutical company wants to compare the effectiveness of four different pain medications. They could conduct multiple two-sample t-tests: Drug A vs. Drug B, Drug A vs. Drug C, Drug A vs. Drug D, Drug B vs. Drug C, Drug B vs. Drug D, and Drug C vs. Drug D. This approach requires six separate tests to compare four groups.

**Educational Research**

An education researcher wants to compare student performance across five different teaching methods. Using pairwise t-tests would require :math:`\binom{5}{2} = 10` separate comparisons.

**Agricultural Studies**

A farmer wants to compare crop yields across six different fertilizer treatments, requiring :math:`\binom{6}{2} = 15` pairwise comparisons.

**The Multiple Testing Problem**

While we could technically perform all these pairwise t-tests, this approach creates a serious statistical problem. If we conduct multiple hypothesis tests, each with significance level :math:`\alpha = 0.05`, our overall probability of making at least one Type I error increases dramatically.

For :math:`k` independent tests, each with individual significance level :math:`\alpha`, the probability of making at least one Type I error is:

.. math::

   \text{Family-wise error rate} = 1 - (1 - \alpha)^k

With just three groups requiring three pairwise tests at :math:`\alpha = 0.05`:

.. math::

   1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 = 1 - (0.95)^3 = 1 - 0.857 = 0.143

Our overall Type I error rate jumps to 14.3%, nearly three times our intended 5% level!

**The ANOVA Solution**

Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) provides an elegant solution by allowing us to test for differences among multiple population means using a single test with a controlled Type I error rate. Rather than asking "Is :math:`\mu_A` different from :math:`\mu_B`?" multiple times, ANOVA asks the global question: "Are any of these population means different from the others?"

Understanding Factor Variables and Levels
--------------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-anova-terminology.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Definition of one-way ANOVA and its key components

ANOVA operates within a framework that distinguishes between two types of variables that play fundamentally different roles in our analysis.

**Factor Variables**

A **factor variable** (also called a categorical variable or treatment variable) is what divides our observations into different groups. This variable defines the populations we want to compare. Factor variables have discrete categories called **levels** that correspond to the different groups in our study.

**Response Variables**

The **response variable** (also called the dependent variable) is the quantitative outcome we measure for each observation. This is what we're comparing across the different levels of the factor variable.

**Examples of Factor Variables and Their Levels**

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-anova-examples.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Practice examples for identifying factor variables and their levels

Let's examine several research scenarios to understand how factor variables work:

*Example 1: Bacterial Growth Study*

A research group studies bacteria growth rates in different sugar solutions.

- **Factor variable**: Type of sugar solution
- **Levels**: Glucose, Sucrose, Fructose, Lactose (4 levels)
- **Response variable**: Bacterial growth rate (quantitative)

*Example 2: Gasoline Brand Efficiency*

Researchers want to determine if five different gasoline brands affect automobile fuel efficiency.

- **Factor variable**: Gasoline brand
- **Levels**: Brand A, Brand B, Brand C, Brand D, Brand E (5 levels)
- **Response variable**: Miles per gallon (quantitative)

*Example 3: Pulp Concentration Study*

Engineers study how hardwood concentration in pulp affects the tensile strength of bags made from the pulp.

- **Factor variable**: Hardwood concentration percentage
- **Levels**: Various predetermined percentages (number depends on study design)
- **Response variable**: Tensile strength of bags (quantitative)

*Example 4: Fabric Dyeing*

Textile researchers investigate whether the amount of dye used affects the color density of fabric.

- **Factor variable**: Amount of dye used
- **Levels**: Different predetermined dye amounts (number depends on study design)
- **Response variable**: Color density measurement (quantitative)

**One-Way vs. Two-Way ANOVA**

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-one-way-diagram.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Conceptual diagram showing how one-way ANOVA compares means across multiple independent populations

The examples above illustrate **one-way ANOVA**, where we have a single factor variable with multiple levels. However, research questions often involve multiple factors simultaneously.

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-two-way-example.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Extension to two-way ANOVA: bacterial growth study with both sugar type and temperature factors

Consider extending the bacterial growth study to include temperature as a second factor:

- **Factor 1**: Sugar solution type (4 levels: Glucose, Sucrose, Fructose, Lactose)
- **Factor 2**: Temperature (4 levels: 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C)
- **Response variable**: Bacterial growth rate

This creates a **two-way ANOVA** scenario with :math:`4 \times 4 = 16` possible combinations of factor levels. Two-way ANOVA allows us to study:

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-two-way-terminology.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Two-way ANOVA definition and objectives

1. **Main effect of sugar type**: How does sugar solution affect growth, averaging across temperatures?
2. **Main effect of temperature**: How does temperature affect growth, averaging across sugar types?
3. **Interaction effect**: Does the effect of sugar type depend on temperature (or vice versa)?

While two-way and higher-order ANOVA designs are important in advanced experimental design, this course focuses on one-way ANOVA to establish the fundamental concepts.

The Fundamental ANOVA Question
---------------------------------

One-way ANOVA addresses a specific research question that can be formulated in several equivalent ways:

**Global Research Question**

"Are there any differences among the population means for the different levels of our factor variable?"

This seemingly simple question encompasses several important aspects:

1. **Simultaneous comparison**: We're comparing all groups at once, not pairwise
2. **Population focus**: We're making inferences about population parameters, not just sample differences
3. **Any differences**: We're asking if there are any differences at all, not which specific groups differ

**Why "Analysis of Variance" for Comparing Means?**

At first glance, it seems strange that a procedure designed to compare means is called "analysis of variance." The answer lies in how ANOVA works: it compares means by analyzing different sources of variability in the data.

The key insight is that if population means are truly equal, then all observations come from populations with the same mean. In this case, the variability between sample means should be no larger than what we'd expect from random sampling variation. However, if population means differ, the sample means will tend to be more spread out than random variation alone would predict.

ANOVA formalizes this logic by:

1. **Decomposing total variability** into components attributable to different sources
2. **Comparing between-group variability** to within-group variability
3. **Using the ratio** of these variabilities as a test statistic

This approach explains why we analyze variance to make inferences about means.

Notation and Framework for Multi-Population Comparisons
----------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-notation-parameters.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Complete notation system for one-way ANOVA parameters and hypotheses

To work systematically with multiple populations, we need organized notation that can handle an arbitrary number of groups.

**Population Parameters**

We have :math:`k` different populations, where :math:`k \geq 3`:

- Population 1 has mean :math:`\mu_1` and variance :math:`\sigma^2_1`
- Population 2 has mean :math:`\mu_2` and variance :math:`\sigma^2_2`
- :math:`\vdots`
- Population :math:`k` has mean :math:`\mu_k` and variance :math:`\sigma^2_k`

**Sample Notation**

From each population, we collect samples that may have different sizes:

- Sample from population :math:`i`: :math:`X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \ldots, X_{in_i}`
- Sample size from population :math:`i`: :math:`n_i`
- Total sample size: :math:`n = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k`

The double subscript notation :math:`X_{ij}` indicates:
- First subscript (:math:`i`): Which population/group (:math:`i = 1, 2, \ldots, k`)
- Second subscript (:math:`j`): Which observation within that group (:math:`j = 1, 2, \ldots, n_i`)

**Sample Statistics with Dot Notation**

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-notation-statistics.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Sample statistics notation for ANOVA

To handle multiple levels of averaging, we use dot notation where dots indicate which indices we're averaging over:

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-notation-means.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Detailed explanation of dot notation for sample means

**Group sample means**: :math:`\bar{X}_{i \cdot} = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} X_{ij}` for :math:`i = 1, 2, \ldots, k`

**Overall sample mean**: :math:`\bar{X}_{\cdot \cdot} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} X_{ij}`

The overall sample mean can also be written as a weighted average of group means:

.. math::

   \bar{X}_{\cdot \cdot} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i \bar{X}_{i \cdot}

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-notation-variance.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Sample variance notation for individual groups

**Group sample variances**: :math:`S^2_i = \frac{1}{n_i - 1} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (X_{ij} - \bar{X}_{i \cdot})^2`

Hypothesis Formulation in ANOVA
------------------------------------

The hypotheses in one-way ANOVA have a specific structure that reflects the global nature of the research question.

**Null Hypothesis**

The null hypothesis states that all population means are equal:

.. math::

   H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \cdots = \mu_k

This can be written equivalently as:

.. math::

   H_0: \text{All population means are equal}

**Alternative Hypothesis**

The alternative hypothesis states that at least one population mean is different from the others. This can be expressed in several equivalent ways:

.. math::

   H_a: \text{At least one } \mu_i \text{ is different from the others}

Or:

.. math::

   H_a: \text{Not all population means are equal}

Or:

.. math::

   H_a: \mu_i \neq \mu_j \text{ for some } i \neq j

**Important Note About the Alternative**

The alternative hypothesis does NOT state that all means are different from each other. It only requires that at least one mean differs from the others. This could mean:

- Only :math:`\mu_1` differs from :math:`\mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4`
- Two groups differ: :math:`\mu_1 = \mu_2 \neq \mu_3 = \mu_4`
- All groups differ: :math:`\mu_1 \neq \mu_2 \neq \mu_3 \neq \mu_4`

The ANOVA test tells us whether we can reject the null hypothesis of complete equality, but additional procedures (covered in Chapter 12.5) are needed to determine which specific groups differ.

A Motivating Example: Coffeehouse Demographics Study
-------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-coffeehouse-example-1.png
   :width: 80%
   
   The coffeehouse demographics study setup

To illustrate these concepts, let's examine a detailed example that demonstrates the ANOVA framework in action.

**Research Context**

A student reporter wants to study the demographics of coffeehouses around campus. Specifically, she's interested in whether different coffeehouses attract customers of different ages. Are certain coffeehouses more popular among graduate students? Do professors tend to favor one coffeehouse over another? Or do all five coffeehouses have roughly equal age demographics?

**Study Design**

The reporter randomly selects 50 customers at each of five coffeehouses using a systematic sampling approach. She visits each coffeehouse at randomly selected times throughout the week to ensure representative sampling. Due to non-response (some customers decline to participate), the final sample sizes vary slightly across coffeehouses but remain close to 50 per location.

**Variable Identification**

- **Factor variable**: Coffeehouse location (5 levels)
- **Response variable**: Customer age (quantitative, measured in years)
- **Research question**: Are there statistically significant differences between the average ages of customers at the different coffeehouses?

**ANOVA Setup**

Let :math:`\mu_i` represent the true mean age of customers at coffeehouse :math:`i`, where :math:`i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

*Hypotheses*:
- :math:`H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 = \mu_5`
- :math:`H_a:` At least one mean age differs from the others

**Preliminary Data Exploration**

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-coffeehouse-boxplots.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Side-by-side boxplots showing customer age distributions across five coffeehouses

Before conducting formal ANOVA procedures, we can gain insights through side-by-side boxplots of customer ages for each coffeehouse. Visual inspection helps us assess:

1. **Apparent differences in group means**: Do the centers of the distributions appear different?
2. **Variability within groups**: Are the spreads similar across groups?
3. **Distribution shapes**: Are the distributions approximately normal?
4. **Outliers**: Are there unusual observations that might affect the analysis?

From the boxplot analysis (as described in the transcript), we observe:

- **Coffeehouse 2** appears to have customers with notably higher average age
- **Coffeehouse 4** appears to have customers with notably lower average age
- The difference between these two coffeehouses is substantial—the mean age at Coffeehouse 2 appears higher than even the maximum age observed at Coffeehouse 4
- Other coffeehouses show more overlapping age distributions

**Visual Prediction**

Based on this preliminary analysis, we might predict that the ANOVA will yield statistically significant results, indicating that at least one coffeehouse has a different mean customer age. Specifically, Coffeehouses 2 and 4 appear clearly different, while additional analysis would be needed to determine relationships among the other locations.

Assumptions for One-Way ANOVA
-----------------------------

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-anova-assumptions.png
   :width: 80%
   
   The four key assumptions required for one-way ANOVA

Like all statistical procedures, ANOVA requires certain assumptions to be valid. These assumptions extend our familiar requirements from two-sample procedures to the multi-group context.

**Assumption 1: Independent Simple Random Samples**

For each of the :math:`k` populations, we must have a simple random sample. Within each group :math:`i`, the observations :math:`X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \ldots, X_{in_i}` must be independent and identically distributed from a population with mean :math:`\mu_i` and variance :math:`\sigma^2_i`.

**Assumption 2: Independence Between Groups**

Samples from different populations must be independent of each other. Knowing the value of any observation from one group should provide no information about observations from other groups.

**Assumption 3: Normality**

Each of the :math:`k` populations must be normally distributed, or the sample sizes must be large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to ensure that sample means are approximately normally distributed.

**Assumption 4: Equal Variances (Homogeneity of Variance)**

Traditional one-way ANOVA assumes that all populations have equal variances:

.. math::

   \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 = \cdots = \sigma^2_k = \sigma^2

This assumption allows us to pool information across groups when estimating the common variance, leading to more efficient procedures.

**Checking the Equal Variance Assumption**

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-checking-homogeneity-1.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Methods for checking the homogeneity of variance assumption

We can check the equal variance assumption using a simple rule of thumb:

.. math::

   \frac{\max(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)}{\min(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)} \leq 2

If the ratio of the largest sample standard deviation to the smallest sample standard deviation is 2 or less, we can reasonably proceed with the equal variance assumption.

**Alternative Approaches When Assumptions Fail**

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-checking-homogeneity-2.png
   :width: 80%
   
   Formal tests for homogeneity of variance (beyond course scope)

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/images/chapter12/slide-assumption-violations.png
   :width: 80%
   
   What to do when the homogeneity assumption is violated

When the equal variance assumption is violated:
- **Welch's F-test**: An extension that doesn't require equal variances (analogous to the unpooled t-test)
- **Transformations**: Log, square root, or other transformations to stabilize variances
- **Nonparametric methods**: Kruskal-Wallis test using ranks instead of raw values

When normality assumptions are severely violated:
- **Larger sample sizes**: Rely more heavily on the Central Limit Theorem
- **Transformations**: May improve normality and equal variance simultaneously
- **Nonparametric alternatives**: Kruskal-Wallis test


The Journey from Description to Inference
----------------------------------------------

ANOVA represents a sophisticated evolution in our statistical thinking. We began this course by describing single datasets, progressed to making inferences about single populations, then extended to comparing two populations. Now we can simultaneously compare multiple populations while maintaining rigorous control over our error rates.

This progression reflects the increasing complexity of real-world research questions. Many important problems involve multiple treatments, conditions, or groups that must be compared simultaneously. ANOVA provides the statistical framework to address these questions in a principled, efficient manner.

The conceptual leap from two-sample procedures to ANOVA also prepares us for even more sophisticated methods. The variance decomposition ideas central to ANOVA form the foundation for experimental design, regression analysis, and many other advanced statistical techniques. By mastering these concepts, we're building the foundation for a lifetime of statistical learning and application.

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **ANOVA extends two-sample procedures to simultaneously compare three or more population means** while controlling overall Type I error rates.
   
   2. **Factor variables with multiple levels define the groups** being compared, while quantitative response variables provide the measurements being analyzed.
   
   3. **The fundamental ANOVA question asks whether any population means differ**, not which specific means differ (that requires additional procedures).
   
   4. **ANOVA compares means by analyzing variance**, decomposing total variability into between-group and within-group components.
   
   5. **Hypotheses have a specific structure**: :math:`H_0` states all means are equal, while :math:`H_a` states at least one mean differs from the others.
   
   6. **Double subscript notation** :math:`X_{ij}` systematically handles multiple groups, with dot notation indicating which indices are averaged over.
   
   7. **Four key assumptions** must be satisfied: independent simple random samples, independence between groups, normality, and equal variances.
   
   8. **Visual exploration using side-by-side boxplots** provides valuable preliminary insights before formal analysis.

The Path Forward: Building the ANOVA Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we understand the conceptual foundation of ANOVA, the next sections will develop the mathematical framework needed to conduct these analyses:

**Chapter 12.2** will show how total variability in our data can be decomposed into components attributable to differences between groups and variability within groups. This variance decomposition forms the theoretical foundation for ANOVA test statistics.

**Chapter 12.3** will construct the F-test statistic by comparing these variance components and introduce the F-distribution for hypothesis testing.

**Chapter 12.4** will demonstrate the connection between ANOVA and our familiar two-sample t-procedures, showing how ANOVA generalizes these methods.

**Chapter 12.5** will address the multiple comparisons problem and provide tools for determining which specific groups differ when ANOVA indicates significant differences.
