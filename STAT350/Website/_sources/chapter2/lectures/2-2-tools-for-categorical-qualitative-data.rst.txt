Tools for Categorical (Qualitative) Data
==================================================================

Numbers alone cannot convey how *popular* a department is, how *balanced* a survey sample appears, 
or whether two demographic variables *interact*. In this lesson, you will learn two plots—
**pie charts** and **bar graphs**—that turn categorical tallies into instant insights.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: tip

   * Build **frequency tables** for categorical variables using three different metrics: **frequency, 
     relative frequency**, and **percentage**.
   * Visualize a frequency table with **pie charts** and **bar graphs**. Learn when
     one is preferred over the other.

The distribution of a categorical variable
---------------------------------------------

The first stage of understanding the **distribution** of a categorical variable is
to  construct a table listing every category together with its count. We will use the 
famous 1973 UC Berkeley Graduate Admissions data set for illustration. This data set is available
by default on RStudio. Run:

.. _import-data:
.. code-block:: r

  # Load required packages

  # If not installed already, install the package first by running
  # install.packages("(package_name)")
  # e.g. if ggplot2 is not installed, run
  # install.packages("ggplot2")

  library(ggplot2)
  library(dplyr)
  library(scales)

  # Load built‑in data
  data("UCBAdmissions")
  df <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)  %>% arrange(Dept, desc(Gender))
  
  View(df)

.. admonition:: Important Note
  :class: error

  Each code block must be run AFTER any previously presented code blocks in
  the same section. If you want to copy and paste the whole code as a single chunk, 
  go to the appendix at the bottom of the page.

The first rows will look like following:

.. _UCB-default-table:
.. flat-table:: 1973 UC Berkeley Graduate Admissions Data
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 1 1 1 1 1
  :width: 50%
  :align: center

  * - Row
    - **Admit**
    - **Gender**
    - **Dept**
    - **Freq**

  * - 1
    - Admitted
    - Male
    - A 
    - 512

  * - 2
    - Rejected
    - Male
    - A 
    - 313
  
  * - 3
    - Admitted
    - Female
    - A 
    - 89
  
  * - 3
    - Rejected
    - Female
    - A 
    - 19

  * - 5
    - Admitted
    - Male
    - B 
    - 353   

  * - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots` 
    - :math:`\vdots`
   
The combination of the first three columns shows the distinct categories that an observation
can belong to. In this dataset, there are 

  - two admission statuses ("Admitted" and "Rejected"),
  - two genders ("Male" and "Female"), and 
  - six departments ("A" through "F"). 

Therefore, the dataset has a total of :math:`2 * 2 * 6 = 24` different categories.
These categories are also called **classes** or **labels**.

The frequencies in the right most column of :numref:`UCB-default-table` show the 
counts for each category. However, frequencies alone make it difficult to assess 
the relative size. For example:

  - Does the class of ["Admitted", "Male", "Dept A"] take up a large proportion
    out of the entire data set? 
  - Is the class of ["Rejected", "Female", "Dept A"]
    one of the smallest? 

For an objective picture, we must take the total count into 
consideration. We use two new metrics for this purpose:

**Relative frequency (proportion)**: The fraction of the count out of the total, computed by
    
.. math::
  relative\text{ }frequency = \dfrac{frequency}{total\text{ }count}

**Percentage**: The relative frequency multiplied by 100%, computed by

.. math::
  percentage = \dfrac{frequency}{total\text{ }count} \cdot 100\%

Using the new metrics, let us create a **full frequency table**.

.. code-block:: r

  #Create the column of relative frequency
  df$Rel_Freq <- df$Freq / sum(df$Freq)
  #Create the column of percentage
  df$Perc <- df$Rel_Freq * 100
  View(df)

Now we see an extended table:

.. flat-table:: Extended 1973 UC Berkeley Admissions Data
  :header-rows: 2
  :widths: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  :width: 70%
  :align: center
  
  * - Row
    - **Admit**
    - **Gender**
    - **Dept**
    - **Freq**
    - **Rel_Freq**
    - **Perc**

  * - 1
    - Admitted
    - Male
    - A 
    - 512
    - 0.113
    - 11.3

  * - 2
    - Rejected
    - Male
    - A 
    - 313
    - 0.069
    - 6.9
  
  * - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots` 
    - :math:`\vdots`
    - :math:`\vdots` 
    - :math:`\vdots`


It is also possible to create extended frequency tables for various
combinations of the three individual categorical variables.
Let's try creating a table displaying the counts of admitted students,
categorized by departments.

  .. code-block:: r

    # Take the subset of the data which only involves "Admitted" category.
    admitted <- df[df$Admit == "Admitted", ]

    # Frequency table of admitted student by department
    df_by_dept <- admitted %>% group_by(Dept) %>% summarise(Freq=sum(Freq))
    df_by_dept$Rel_Freq <- df_by_dept$Freq / sum(df_by_dept$Freq)
    df_by_dept$Perc <- df_by_dept$Rel_Freq * 100

.. flat-table::
  :header-rows: 2
  :widths: 1 1 1 1
  :width: 80%
  :align: center

  * - :cspan:`3` Admitted Applicants by Department

  * - Department Label
    - Frequency
    - Relative Frequency
    - Percentage

  * - **A**
    - 601
    - 0.342
    - 34.2

  * - **B**
    - 307
    - 0.211
    - 21.1

  * - **C**
    - 322
    - 0.183
    - 18.3

  * - **D**
    - 269
    - 0.153
    - 15.3

  * - **E**
    - 147
    - 0.0838
    - 8.38

  * - **F**
    - 46
    - 0.0262
    - 2.62

Note that relative frequencies always **fall between 0 and 1** and **sum to 1**. Likewise,
the percentages always range **from 0 to 100** and **sum to 100**. They provide a standardized 
representation of the counts and allow comparisons between different variables that 
share the same list of categories, even if their totals differ.

Pie charts
-----------------------------------

A **pie chart** represents a categorical variable as a sliced circle, 
where the slices are sized proportionally to the counts, relative frequencies,
or percentages. Note that the outcome will be visually identical regardless of the
chosen metric.

Pie charts are best when you need to emphasize that the categories make up a 
complete whole, and if your main goal is to compare the relative sizes of
the labels within a single dataset.

Let us draw the pie charts of the admission status variable, for each gender.
We begin by creating the corresponding extended frequency tables:

.. code-block:: r

  # Only the code for the female case is shown for conciseness. Try creating 
  # the code for the other case using this as a template.
  
  # Take the subset of the data which only involves the "Female" category.
  female <- df[df$Gender == "Female", ]

  # Frequency table of admitted student by department
  admit_female <- female %>% group_by(Admit) %>% summarise(Freq=sum(Freq))
  admit_female$Rel_Freq <- admit_female$Freq / sum(admit_female$Freq)
  admit_female$Perc <- admit_female$Rel_Freq * 100

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows: 2
    :widths: 1 1 1 1
    :width: 80%
    :align: center

    * - :cspan:`3` Admission for Female Applicants

    * - Label
      - Frequency
      - Relative Frequency
      - Percentage

    * - **Admitted**
      - 557
      - 0.304
      - 30.4

    * - **Rejected**
      - 1278
      - 0.696
      - 69.6

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows: 2
    :widths: 1 1 1 1
    :width: 80%
    :align: center

    * - :cspan:`3` Admission for Male Applicants

    * - Label
      - Frequency
      - Relative Frequency
      - Percentage

    * - **Admitted**
      - 1198
      - 0.445
      - 44.5

    * - **Rejected**
      - 1493
      - 0.555
      - 55.5

Using the tables above, create pie charts:

.. code-block:: r

  #Pie chart for female applicants
  ggplot(admit_female, aes(x = "", y = Freq, fill = Admit)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1, colour = "black", size = 1.25) +
    coord_polar(theta = "y", start = 0) + 
    geom_text(aes(label = percent(Rel_Freq)),
              position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size=5)+
    theme_void()+
    ggtitle("Acceptance Rate of Female Applicants")

.. _pie-male-female:

  :align: center
  :figwidth: 90%
  :alt: UCB admission by gender

  1973 UC Berkeley graduate admissions, by gender

Pie charts are effective for an intuitive presentation of 
the variable composition, especially when **there are only few categories** 
or when the **imbalance among the proportions** needs to be emphasized.

The pie charts in :numref:`pie-male-female` display the distributions
of graduate admissions for female and male applicants at UC Berkeley 
in 1973. They *seem* to suggest that there was a significant difference 
in the likelihood of acceptance between genders.
We now proceed to the next section to explore this from another perspective.

Bar graphs
--------------------------

A **bar graph** draws one bar per category with the height proportional to its 
frequency. Bars may represent counts, relative counts, or percentages.

Bar graphs offer several advantages over pie charts:

* Pie charts lose their simplicity when there are more than a few categories.
  In contrast, bar graphs handle many categories more effectively.
* They allow **exact comparisons** of relative sizes, especially when 
  frequencies are similar.
* When observations can belong to multiple categories,
  it is incorrect to suggest that the frequencies form a whole - 
  since their total may exceed 100%. In such cases, bar graphs are more appropriate, 
  as they do not imply that the parts sum to a whole.

To demonstrate the strength of bar graphs in handling many categories, let us plot
:numref:`UCB-default-table`, which contains 24 different categories.

.. code-block:: r 

  df$Dept_Gender <- paste(df$Dept, df$Gender, sep="-")

  ggplot(df, aes(x = Dept_Gender, y = Freq, fill = Admit)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge", width=0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Dodged bar graph of frequencies",
       x = "Department-Gender",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10))

.. _dodged-bar:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter2/UCB-Freq.png
  :figwidth: 90%
  :align: center
  :alt: Bar graph of frequencies, UC Berkeley graduate admissions data

  Bar graph of frequencies, UC Berkeley data set

Unlike our first impression through the pie charts (:numref:`pie-male-female`),
we begin to suspect that the acceptance rates are comparable
between the two genders within a department.

To dig deeper into our suspicion, let us draw another bar graph, where
each bar has a height corresponding to the relative frequency of an admission result
within a single department, for a single gender. In addition, we will *stack* the
bars so that the composition of "Accepted" vs "Rejected" is emphasized within
each Department-Gender category.

.. code-block:: r 

  Dept_Gender_total <- as.vector((df %>% group_by(Dept_Gender) %>% summarise(Sum=sum(Freq)))$Sum)
  df$Dept_Gender_total <- rep(Dept_Gender_total, each=2)
  df$Dept_Gender_Rel_Freq <- df$Freq/df$Dept_Gender_total


  ggplot(df, aes(x = Dept_Gender, y = Dept_Gender_Rel_Freq, fill = Admit)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="stack", width=0.5) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = "Stacked bar graph of relative frequencies by Dept and Gender",
        x = "Department-Gender",
        y = "Relative Frequency") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10))

.. _stacked-bar:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter2/UCB-Rel-Freq-Dept-Gender.png
  :figwidth: 90%
  :align: center
  :alt:

  Bar graph of relative frequencies of "Accepted" vs "Rejected" by Dept-Gender,
  UC Berkeley data set

Our suspicion is comfirmed. Indeed, the two genders have comparable acceptance rates
within departments. In four of the six departments, the rate is actually higher
for female students!

We covered two key techniques in drawing a bar graph through the UC Berkeley example.

- **Dodging** bars side‑by‑side lets us *compare* groups across categories (:numref:`dodged-bar`).
- **Stacking** bars emphasizes *composition* within each category (:numref:`stacked-bar`).

.. admonition:: Remark - What's behind the contradiction?
  :class: important 

  The pie charts and the bar graphs appear to convey **conflicting messages**, 
  even though they are based on the same data set. This discrepancy arises because 
  certain departments had a disproportionately large number of applicants—most of
  whom were male.

  This highlights the importance of **examining a data set carefully at multiple 
  levels of categorization** before drawing conclusions. In fact, this situation 
  illustrates a well-known and frequently occurring statistical phenomenon called 
  **Simpson’s Paradox**.

  Feel free to explore this fascinating topic further on your own!

Pie Chart or Bar Graph?
--------------------------------------------------

Choosing between pie charts and bar graphs depends on your data and the story you want to tell:

* Bar graphs handle many categories comfortably; a pie chart with more than five slices becomes hard to read.
* Exact comparisons across categories are easier in a bar graph because the common baseline (zero) guides the eye.
* Bar graphs work well when observations can belong to multiple categories.
* If your takeaway is "X accounts for one‑third of the total," a pie slice delivers that message immediately.
* Pie charts emphasize the part-to-whole relationship and are ideal when your data represents 100% of something.

Bringing It All Together
--------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   #. The distribution of a categorical variable is first organized into a table of 
      **categories** (also called **labels** or **classes**) with their counts, 
      proportions, or percentages.
   #. Pie charts emphasize **part of whole**; bar graphs emphasize **category comparisons**.
   #. Choose **dodged** or **stacked** bar graphs based on the message you want to convey.
      Dodged bar graphs allow precise comparison of heights; stacked bar graphs
      focuses on showing the composition within a category.
   #. Examine categorical data from multiple perspectives to avoid misleading interpretations.

These exercises build your skills in summarizing and visualizing categorical data using frequency tables, pie charts, and bar graphs.

.. admonition:: Exercise 1: Frequency Tables and Calculations
   :class: note

   A software company tracks bug reports by severity level. Over the past month, their bug tracking system recorded the following:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 25 20

      * - Severity Level
        - Frequency

        - 45
      * - Medium
        - 78
      * - Low
        - 115

   a. What is the total number of bug reports?

   b. Calculate the **relative frequency** for each severity level. Verify that your relative frequencies sum to 1.

   c. Calculate the **percentage** for each severity level. Verify that your percentages sum to 100%.

   d. What proportion of all bugs are classified as "High" or "Critical"? Express your answer as both a relative frequency and a percentage.

   e. A manager claims that "fewer than one in four bugs are serious (High or Critical)." Is this claim supported by the data?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Total**

      Total = 12 + 45 + 78 + 115 = **250 bug reports**

      **Part (b): Relative Frequencies**

      **Part (c): Percentages**

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 15 25

         * - Severity
           - Frequency
           - Percentage
         * - Critical
           - 12
           - **4.8%**
         * - High

           - 250
           - **100.0%** ✓

      **Part (d): High or Critical Combined**

      Frequency of High or Critical = 12 + 45 = 57

      - Relative frequency = 57/250 = **0.228**
      - Percentage = **22.8%**

      **Part (e): Evaluating the Claim**

      The manager claims "fewer than one in four" (i.e., < 25%) are serious.

      Since 22.8% < 25%, **the claim is supported by the data**. Indeed, fewer than one in four bugs are classified as High or Critical.

   e. The firm wants to compare CAD preferences across three different offices. Would you recommend three separate pie charts or a grouped bar graph? Justify your choice.

      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): SolidWorks Count**

      35% of 400 = 0.35 × 400 = **140 engineers**

      **Part (b): AutoCAD or CATIA**

      (28% + 18%) of 400 = 46% of 400 = 0.46 × 400 = **184 engineers**

      **Part (c): Why Pie Chart is Appropriate**

      Two valid reasons:

      1. **The data represents a complete whole**: Every engineer chose exactly one option, so the categories sum to 100%. Pie charts excel at showing part-to-whole relationships.

      2. **Few categories**: With only 5 categories, the pie chart remains readable. Pie charts become cluttered with more than 5-6 slices.

      Other valid reasons: The goal is to show relative proportions; each slice represents a mutually exclusive category.

      **Part (d): Multiple Selections**

      **No, a pie chart would NOT be appropriate.** If engineers could select multiple packages, the percentages would sum to more than 100% (e.g., 35% + 28% + 18% + ... might equal 150% if many selected two options).

      Pie charts imply that slices represent parts of a single whole. When categories are not mutually exclusive, a **bar graph** should be used instead, as it does not imply that the bars must sum to 100%.

      **Part (e): Comparing Across Offices**

      A **grouped (dodged) bar graph** would be better than three separate pie charts for several reasons:

      1. **Direct comparison**: Bar graphs with a common baseline make it easy to compare the same category across offices (e.g., "Which office uses SolidWorks most?")

      2. **Aligned categories**: Side-by-side bars allow immediate visual comparison; with separate pie charts, the eye must jump between charts and compare slice sizes at different angles

      3. **Scalability**: If a fourth office is added later, another set of bars is straightforward; adding a fourth pie chart makes comparison increasingly difficult

   d. A manager wants to know: "Is Hardware Failure more common at night than during the day?" Can you answer this using counts alone, or do you need percentages? Explain and provide the answer.

   e. If this data were displayed as a **dodged** bar graph instead of stacked, what comparison would become easier? What comparison would become harder?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Most Total Incidents**

      - Day Shift: 45 incidents
      - Evening Shift: 50 incidents
      - Night Shift: 50 incidents

      **Evening and Night Shifts are tied** with 50 incidents each.

      **Part (b): Most Common Incident Type**

      - **Day Shift**: Software Crash (22 out of 45 = 48.9%) is most common
      - **Night Shift**: Network Issue (25 out of 50 = 50%) is most common

      **Part (c): Night Shift Network Issues Percentage**

      Network Issues on Night Shift = 25
      Total Night Shift incidents = 50

      Percentage = (25/50) × 100% = **50%**

      **Part (d): Hardware Failure Comparison**

      **Percentages are needed** because the total incidents differ between shifts (45 vs 50). Raw counts can be misleading.

      - Day Shift Hardware Failures: 8/45 = **17.8%**
      - Night Shift Hardware Failures: 15/50 = **30.0%**

      **Yes, Hardware Failure is more common at night** (30.0% vs 17.8%)—nearly twice the rate.

      Using counts alone (8 vs 15) would suggest night has more, but the totals are different. The percentage confirms the pattern holds even after accounting for different totals.

      **Part (e): Dodged vs Stacked Trade-offs**

      For comparison, here is the same data displayed as a **dodged bar graph**:

         Server incidents by shift (dodged bar graph)

      **Easier with dodged bars**:
      
      - Comparing the same incident type across shifts (e.g., "How does Hardware Failure compare across all three shifts?")
      - The common baseline (zero) makes height comparisons precise

      **Harder with dodged bars**:
      
      - Seeing the total incidents per shift at a glance
      - Understanding the composition/proportion of incident types within each shift
      - Stacked bars make it immediately clear that Software dominates Day Shift while Network dominates Night Shift

.. admonition:: Exercise 4: Choosing the Right Visualization
   :class: note

   For each scenario below, determine whether a **pie chart** or **bar graph** would be more appropriate. If bar graph, specify whether **stacked** or **dodged** would be better. Justify your choice.

   a. **Scenario A**: Showing the market share of five smartphone manufacturers, where the goal is to emphasize that Samsung holds nearly one-third of the global market.

   b. **Scenario B**: Comparing customer satisfaction ratings (Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied) across four different product lines.

   c. **Scenario C**: Displaying the programming languages known by developers at a tech company, where developers can list multiple languages.

   d. **Scenario D**: Showing how a project's budget is allocated across 12 different expense categories.

   e. **Scenario E**: Showing the composition of pass/fail rates within each of 6 quality inspection stations to identify which stations have the highest failure rates.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Scenario A: Smartphone Market Share**

      **Pie chart** is appropriate.

      - The data represents a complete whole (100% of market)
      - Few categories (5 manufacturers)
      - The stated goal is to emphasize "one-third"—pie charts excel at communicating "X accounts for one-third of the total"
      - Part-to-whole relationship is the focus

      **Scenario B: Satisfaction Across Product Lines**

      **Dodged bar graph** is appropriate.

      - Need to compare the same rating level across 4 different products
      - Bar graphs allow precise comparison using a common baseline
      - Four separate pie charts would make cross-product comparison difficult
      - 5 rating categories × 4 products = 20 bars, manageable in dodged format

      **Scenario C: Programming Languages (Multiple Selection)**

      **Bar graph** is required (pie chart is inappropriate).

      - Developers can select multiple languages, so percentages will sum to more than 100%
      - Pie charts require mutually exclusive categories that sum to a whole
      - A simple bar graph showing the count or percentage for each language works well
      - No stacking or dodging needed if just showing one dimension

      **Scenario D: Budget Across 12 Categories**

      **Bar graph** is better than pie chart.

      - 12 categories is too many for a readable pie chart (guideline: ≤5-6 slices)
      - Bar graphs handle many categories comfortably
      - Could be a simple bar graph (no stacking/dodging needed with single budget)
      - *However*, if the goal is strictly to show part-of-whole for a single budget, a treemap might be considered as an alternative

      **Scenario E: Pass/Fail Composition by Station**

      **Stacked bar graph** is appropriate.

      - Goal is to see composition (pass vs fail) **within** each station
      - Stacked bars emphasize the proportion of each component within categories
      - All bars would reach the same height (100%), making failure rate proportions immediately visible
      - Alternative: Could use stacked bars showing percentages, so each station's bar reaches 100%

      Recovery rates by hospital — New Drug wins at both!

   a. At Hospital A, which treatment has a higher recovery rate?

   b. At Hospital B, which treatment has a higher recovery rate?

   c. Combine the data from both hospitals. Calculate the overall recovery rate for the New Drug and for the Standard treatment.

   d. Based on your answer to (c), which treatment appears better when looking at the combined data?

   e. This is an example of **Simpson's Paradox**. The New Drug has a higher recovery rate at *both* hospitals, yet appears worse overall. In your own words, explain why this happens. What is the confounding factor?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Hospital A**

      - New Drug: 20% recovery rate
      - Standard: 10% recovery rate

      **New Drug is better at Hospital A** (20% > 10%)

      **Part (b): Hospital B**

      - New Drug: 75% recovery rate
      - Standard: 67% recovery rate

      **New Drug is better at Hospital B** (75% > 67%)

      **Part (c): Combined Data**

      **New Drug (combined):**
      
      - Recovered: 200 + 15 = 215
      - Total patients: (200 + 800) + (15 + 5) = 1000 + 20 = 1020
      - Recovery Rate: 215/1020 = **21.1%**

      **Standard (combined):**
      
      - Recovered: 10 + 400 = 410
      - Total patients: (10 + 90) + (400 + 200) = 100 + 600 = 700
      - Recovery Rate: 410/700 = **58.6%**

      **Part (d): Which Appears Better Overall?**

      Looking at combined data: Standard (58.6%) > New Drug (21.1%)

         Overall recovery rates — Standard wins when combined!

      **Standard appears better overall**—even though New Drug won at both hospitals!

      **Part (e): Explanation of Simpson's Paradox**

      This paradox occurs because of **unequal distribution of patients across hospitals with very different baseline recovery rates**.

      .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/Exercises/ch2-2/ex5_simpson_sample_sizes.png
         :align: center
         :figwidth: 80%
         :alt: Sample sizes by hospital and treatment

         Sample sizes reveal the confounding factor

      Key observations:
      
      - **Hospital A** has a very low overall recovery rate (severe cases)
      - **Hospital B** has a high overall recovery rate (mild cases)
      - Most New Drug patients (1000 of 1020) were at Hospital A (the "hard" hospital)
      - Most Standard patients (600 of 700) were at Hospital B (the "easy" hospital)

      The **confounding factor** is **patient severity/hospital assignment**. The New Drug was primarily tested on difficult cases (Hospital A), while Standard was primarily used on easier cases (Hospital B).

      When we aggregate, we're not comparing like with like—we're comparing a treatment used mostly on severe cases against one used mostly on mild cases. This masks the fact that *when compared fairly within the same hospital*, New Drug outperforms Standard every time.

      **The lesson**: Always examine data at multiple levels of categorization before drawing conclusions. Aggregated data can reverse patterns visible in subgroups.

.. admonition:: Exercise 6: Creating and Interpreting Frequency Tables
   :class: note

   A quality control team inspects circuit boards and categorizes defects. The inspection results for 500 boards are:

   - 25 boards had **both cosmetic and functional defects**

   a. Create a complete frequency table with columns for: Category, Frequency, Relative Frequency, and Percentage.

   b. What percentage of boards had at least one defect (of any type)?

   c. If you wanted to visualize the proportion of defect-free vs defective boards, would you use a pie chart or bar graph? Why?

   d. If you wanted to compare defect rates across three different manufacturing plants, what type of visualization would you recommend?

           - **1.000**
           - **100.0%**

      **Part (b): Boards with At Least One Defect**

      Boards with at least one defect = 95 + 60 + 25 = 180

      Percentage = 180/500 × 100% = **36.0%**

      (Alternatively: 100% - 64% = 36%)

      **Part (c): Defect-Free vs Defective Visualization**

      **Pie chart** would be appropriate because:

      - Only 2 categories (defect-free vs defective) if simplified, or 4 categories as recorded
      - Data represents a complete whole (all 500 boards)
      - Goal is to show part-to-whole relationship
      - Simple message: "About two-thirds of boards are defect-free"

         Circuit board inspection results

      A bar graph would also work, but a pie chart effectively communicates the proportion at a glance for this small number of categories.

      **Part (d): Comparing Across Plants**

      **Grouped (dodged) or stacked bar graph** would be best.

      - Need to compare the same defect category across 3 plants
      - **Dodged**: Better if the goal is to compare raw counts or rates of specific defect types across plants
      - **Stacked (with percentages)**: Better if the goal is to show the composition of defect types within each plant while allowing comparison

      Three separate pie charts would be harder to compare directly.

      **Part (e): Tracking Over Time (12 Months)**

      **Line graph** would be most appropriate for tracking trends over time.

      - Time is the x-axis (12 months)
      - Defect rate (percentage) is the y-axis
      - Line graph shows trends, patterns, and changes over time clearly
      - Could have multiple lines if tracking different defect types separately

      A bar graph (with one bar per month) could work but is less effective for showing trends. Pie charts are not suitable for time series data.

.. dropdown:: Answers to Practice Problems
   :class-container: sd-border-success

   **True/False Answers:**

   1. **True** — By definition, relative frequency = frequency/total, so summing all relative frequencies gives total/total = 1. Similarly, percentages = relative frequencies × 100, so they sum to 100%.

   2. **False** — Pie charts require mutually exclusive categories that sum to a whole. If observations can belong to multiple categories, percentages may exceed 100%, making pie charts misleading. Use a bar graph instead.

   3. **False** — Stacked bar graphs make it **harder** to compare exact heights of interior segments (non-baseline categories) because they don't share a common baseline. Dodged bar graphs, with all bars starting at zero, make exact comparisons easier.

   4. **True** — Pie charts become difficult to read with more than 5-6 slices. With 15 categories, a bar graph handles the many categories much more effectively.

   5. **False** — Relative frequency is calculated by dividing the category's frequency by the **total count**, not by 100. To get percentage, you multiply relative frequency by 100.

   6. **True** — Simpson's Paradox occurs when a trend present in subgroups reverses or disappears when data is aggregated. The UC Berkeley admissions example and Exercise 5 demonstrate this phenomenon.

   **Multiple Choice Answers:**

   7. **Ⓐ** — Relative frequency = 60/200 = 0.30. Note that Ⓒ (30) is the percentage (30%), not the relative frequency.

   8. **Ⓒ** — When users can select multiple platforms, the percentages will sum to more than 100%. Pie charts require mutually exclusive categories forming a complete whole. All other options represent proper part-to-whole scenarios.

   9. **Ⓒ** — A dodged bar graph allows direct comparison of the same product category across all three regions using a common baseline. Three separate pie charts make cross-region comparison difficult; a single combined pie chart loses regional information; histograms are for continuous numerical data, not categorical.

   10. **Ⓑ** — In a stacked bar graph, the total height of each bar represents the sum of all segments—in this case, the total number of employees at that location (Engineering + Sales + Marketing).
