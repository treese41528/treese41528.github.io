Exploring Quantitative Distributions: Modality, Skewness & Outliers
=============================================================================

Histograms reveal patterns that help us interpret the overall shape of a data distribution.
In this lesson, we will develop a systematic approach to reading data from histograms by 
focusing on three key characteristics: **modality, skewness, and outliers**.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   • Identify overall patterns in histograms, examining **shape, center, and spread**.
   • Distinguish between **unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal** distributions.
   • Recognize **symmetric versus skewed** distributions.
   • Learn to spot **potential outliers** that may require further investigation.

Looking for Patterns in Histograms

Once we generate a histogram, we begin our data-reading process by
noting the basic properties such as the **center** and **spread** of the data.

* **Center**: Where is the bulk of the data located? Is there one central location or multiple?
* **Spread**: How widely dispersed are the values around these central locations?

According to :numref:`furnace`, the center of the furnace data set is located around 10,
and it spans a range between 0 and 20, approximately.

After covering the basics, we move on to classify the **shape** of the data distribution based 
on a few key characteristics:

* **Modality**
* **Skewness**
* Presence of any **potential outliers**

Let us now discuss each of these charachteristics in detail.
 
Modality: Counting the Peaks
--------------------------------

Modality tells us whether our data is concentrated around a single location or multiple locations.

A **mode** is a local peak in a histogram or density curve. The number of modes helps us understand 
whether our data might represent one homogeneous population or multiple distinct subgroups.

**Unimodal distributions** have a single peak, suggesting that the data is coming from a single 
population centered around a unique location. Most textbook examples show unimodal distributions 
in the classic "bell curve" shape just like :numref:`furnace`, 
but a unimodal distribution can take many forms - it only needs to have one primary peak.

**Bimodal distributions** show two peaks in their histograms.
The existence of two *centers* might indicate that the data was sampled from two different populations 
with distinct characteristics.

**Multimodal distributions** have two or more peaks in their histograms, potentially indicating that  
the data was collected from several different populations.

.. admonition:: Caution 🛑
   :class: danger

   Sometimes, apparent multimodality in a histogram can be an artifact of using too 
   many bins rather than a genuine feature of the data. If the bin count is too large, 
   you'll tend to see several modes simply because individual data points are highlighted
   rather than the overall summary. This is why choosing an appropriate 
   bin size is crucial when creating histograms.

.. admonition:: Example 💡: Old Faithful Eruption Data
   
   Let's examine the eruption data of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. 
   This built-in R dataset contains measurements on both the waiting time between eruptions 
   and the duration of eruptions themselves. Let us plot the histograms of both variables.

   .. code-block:: r

      library(ggplot2)
      data(faithful) # Load Old Faithful dataset
      nbins <- round(sqrt(nrow(faithful))) + 2

      # Plot eruption times
      ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = nbins, fill = "dodgerblue", colour = "black", linewidth = 1) +
      geom_density(colour = "red", linewidth = 1.2) +
      labs(title = "Old Faithful eruption lengths – bimodal distribution",
            x = "Eruption time (minutes)", y = "Frequency")

      # Plot waiting times using your own code

   .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter2/old-faithful-eruption-time.png 
      :figwidth: 90%
      :align: center 
      :alt: Histogram of length of eruption of the Old Faithful geyser

      Length of eruption

   The eruption time histogram shows two distinct peaks - one around 2 minutes and another 
   around 4.5 minutes. This indicates that eruptions tend to fall into two categories: shorter 
   eruptions and longer eruptions, with relatively few eruptions of intermediate length.

   .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter2/old-faithful-wait-time.png 
      :figwidth: 90%
      :align: center 
      :alt: Histogram of waiting duration of the Old Faithful geyser

      Waiting duration

   Similarly, the waiting time histogram reveals two modes - shorter waiting periods and longer ones, 
   with a dip in the middle region around 60 minutes. This pattern tells us something about the frequency 
   of eruptions: if you've waited about an hour without seeing an eruption, you'll likely need to wait 
   another 30-60 minutes.

   The bimodality in both variables reflects the physical processes 
   within the geyser. Short eruptions tend to be followed by shorter waiting times, while long eruptions 
   precede longer waiting intervals. The red density curves capture this bimodal pattern beautifully. In contrast, 
   the blue normal curves clearly 
   fail to capture the two-peaked nature of the data, showing how misleading it would be to treat this 
   data as a simple unimodal distribution.

   This example illustrates an important principle: when you encounter multimodality, it often signals 
   the presence of distinct subgroups that should be analyzed separately rather than averaged together.

Symmetry and Skewness
------------------------

When examining a histogram, we need to determine whether the data is symmetric or skewed.
We call a data **symmetric** if its distribution is reasonably balanced around a central value.

When the data is not symmetric, we call it right- or left-skewed.
The **direction of the tail determines the direction of skewness**:

* If the tail stretches toward higher values, the distribution is right (or positively) skewed. 
* If the tail stretches toward lower values, the distribution is left (or negatively) skewed.

   .. admonition:: Example 💡 – Black Cherry Trees Data

      .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter2/tree-height-hist.png
         :alt: Histogram of Black Cherry tree heights
         :align: center

      Let's examine the built-in `trees` dataset in R, which contains measurements on 31 felled black cherry trees, including their height (in feet), diameter (in inches), and volume (in cubic feet).

      When we create histograms for these variables, we can practice identifying their skewness:

      .. code-block:: r

         library(ggplot2)
         data(trees)
         
         # Height histogram
         ggplot(trees, aes(Height)) +
         geom_histogram(bins = 8, fill = "lightblue", colour = "black") +
         labs(title = "Black Cherry tree heights",
               x = "Height (feet)", y = "Frequency")
         
         # Similar code for Girth (diameter) and Volume histograms

      Looking at the height histogram, the distribution appears roughly symmetric, though it might be pulled slightly to the left (negative skew). Most trees are concentrated in the middle height range, with a fairly balanced spread in both directions.

      The diameter (girth) histogram shows a positive skew, with most trees having smaller diameters and fewer trees with larger diameters. The distribution is noticeably pulled to the right.

      The volume histogram also displays a positive skew. Although there appears to be a jump in one of the bins, this is likely due to random sampling variation rather than representing a true bimodal pattern, especially considering the small sample size of only 31 trees.

      With such a small sample size, it's important to be cautious about drawing definitive conclusions about the underlying population distributions. If we were to observe more trees, we would likely confirm that both diameter and volume follow positively skewed distributions, while height is more symmetric or slightly negatively skewed.

Identifying Potential Outliers
-----------------------------------

When examining a histogram, we also want to look for potential **outliers** - data points that deviate significantly 
from the overall pattern of the data.They are important to investigate because:

1. They may represent errors in data collection or entry
2. They could be valid but unusual observations that provide valuable insights
3. They can significantly influence statistical measures like the mean
4. They may indicate violations of assumptions in statistical inference procedures

When R creates a histogram, it automatically determines an appropriate range for the axes to ensure all data points
are included in the plot. If there are values far from the majority of the data, the plotting range will be extended 
to include them, creating visible gaps in the histogram where no observations fall.

   :figwidth: 80%

When we spot potential outliers, we should not immediately discard them. Instead, we need to investigate why they 
differ from the rest of the data. They might represent important characteristics of our population or they might 
be erroneous entries that need correction.

Bringing It All Together
------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. Histograms reveal the shape, center, spread, and potential outliers in a quantitative data.
   2. Potential outliers require careful investigation - they may represent errors or important observations.
   3. Understanding distribution shapes helps us choose appropriate statistical tools and avoid misleading 
      conclusions.

Exercises

1. **Old Faithful Analysis.** Using the `faithful` dataset, create histograms for both eruption duration 
   and waiting time. Describe the modality and skewness of each. How might these patterns relate to the 
   physical behavior of the geyser?
