Course Introduction & Overview
==========================================

Welcome to **STAT 350: Introduction to Statistics**.

Statistics isn't just about crunching numbers and creating graphs. At its core, statistics is about understanding uncertainty and making well-informed decisions based on evidence. Whether you're pursuing engineering, life sciences, social sciences, or just sharpening your critical thinking skills, this course is designed to equip you with the fundamental tools you need.

Why Statistics? Why Now?
------------------------

We live in an era dominated by data. Practically every decision, from public health policies to business strategies, depends on accurate statistical reasoning. 

- **Critical decision-making**: Statistics is the backbone of research and industry decisions. Incorrect interpretation can have serious real-world consequences.
- **Understanding uncertainty**: Life is unpredictable, and data often reflect that. Statistical methods are essential to quantify, understand, and communicate uncertainty clearly and accurately.
- **The backbone of AI and machine learning**: All modern AI models, including tools like ChatGPT, rely heavily on probability theory and statistical modeling. These techniques are critical for building and improving AI systems and interpreting their results accurately.

Course Roadmap

   * - **Chapters**
     - **What you'll explore**
     - **Connections with other chapters**

   * - *Ch 1–3*
     - **Descriptive Statistics** 
     
       Visualize and summarize data. Find patterns effectively.
     - Systematically describe the visible surface of data

   * - *Ch 4–6* 
     - **Probability**

       Theoretical foundation on the system which produces randomness and uncertainty in everyday phenomena.
     - Understand the data-generating mechanism which results in data shown in Ch 1-3

   * - *Ch 7*
     - **Sampling Distributions**

       How and why do sample results vary? What is their relation to the rules governing data generation?
     - Bridges Ch 1-3 and Ch 4-6

   * - *Ch 8* 
     - **Experimental Design**

       Design solid studies and avoiding common pitfalls.
     - Ensures necessary conditions are met for Ch 7 to hold.

   * - *Ch 9*
     - **Confidence Intervals and Bounds**

       Identify regions that likely contain the true parameter.
     - :rspan:`1` Foundational forms of statistical inference. Both build on Ch 7.

   * - *Ch 10*
     - **Hypothesis Testing**

       Evaluate claims, understand evidence, and make decisions in the face of uncertainty.

   * - *Ch 11* 
     - **Two-Sample Methods**

       Compare the centers of two groups.
     - :rspan:`2` Advanced inference methods based on Ch 9-10

   * - *Ch 12* 
     - **ANOVA**

       Compare the centers of multiple groups simultaneously. 
     
   * - *Ch 13* 
     - **Linear Regression**

       Model the association of two variables with a line.

     

A Clear Note on Using AI
--------------------------

AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are powerful resources. However, relying on AI purely to save time 
without developing deep understanding will leave you vulnerable in the job market. The future workforce 
demands critical thinkers capable of leveraging AI, not those easily replaced by it.

When using AI to assist you in this course,

- Clearly learn the advantages and limitations of current AI resources in generating academic contents.
- Verifying AI-generated content against externel resources before use is strongly encouraged. 
- When including AI-generated content in an assignment, whether directly or indirectly, you must include a note clearly citing where and how you used it:

.. admonition:: A Guide for Proper AI Citation
   :class: tip

   - State the AI tool used (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot).
   - Describe your prompt.
   - Clarify how you verified and/or modified the AI-generated content.

   * - ✔❓
     - To do
     - Description
   
   * -
     - Familiarize yourself with course organization
     - Review the syllabus carefully. Mark the exam dates and the weekly deadlines.

   * - 
     - Setup RStudio
     - We use a programming language called **R**, and a graphical user interface (GUI) called **RStudio** for 
       statistical computing. Set up your R environment using `Computer Assignment 1 Tutorial <https://treese41528.github.io/STAT350/Computer_Assignment_Tutorials/Computer_Assignment_1_Tutorial.html>`_.

   * - 
     - Bookmark and explore the three online resources
     - The three major websites used in this course are: 
       
       * **Edfinity** for homework (see the next section), 
       * **Brightspace** for communication, and
       * **this location** for course material.  

   * - 
     - Get started on the first assignments
     - The **Syllabus Homework, your student profile, Homework Assignment 1, and Computer Assignment 1** are 
       due within the first couple of weeks
       in the semester. Mark their deadlines and get started as soon as possible!

Homework Assignments on Edfinity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The homework assignments will be distributed via the **Edfinity** platform. Edfinity provides 
interactive problems with partially automated grading and instant feedback for the auto-graded 
questions. You must sign up through any link to Edfinity assignments on Brightspace. 
There will be two types of Edfinity assignments:

- **Standard homework assignments**: Short-answer and multiple-choice questions, no external datasets 
  required, automatically graded.

- **Computer assignments**: These involve data analysis in R, submitted directly on Edfinity. These 
  assignments are manually graded, with feedback typically provided within one week.

Miscellaneous Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Please note ‼️
   :class: important

   * The slides provided are dynamic and should always be viewed in **slideshow mode** to display all content correctly.
   * Homework grades may appear on Brightspace before grading is complete due to Edfinity’s autograde feature. Please  allow one week after the deadline for grades to be finalized.
   * For comprehensive review (especially useful for the final exam), refer to the interactive `Comprehensive Statistics Guide <https://treese41528.github.io/STAT350/StatisticsProcedures.html>`_.


Looking forward to a productive semester. Let's dive into statistics!
