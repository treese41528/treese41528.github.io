Discrete Random Variables and Probability Mass Distributions
============================================================================

In previous chapters, we used set theory to describe events and their probabilities. 
While this approach provides a rigorous foundation, it can become cumbersome when dealing with 
complex scenarios. Random variables offer a more elegant solution by mapping outcomes directly 
to numbers.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   * Define **random variables** as functions that map real-life events of
     arbitrary complexity to their numerical representations.
   * Distinguish between **discrete** and **continuous** random variables.
   * Formalize **probability mass functions** (PMFs) for discrete random variables.
   * Apply PMFs to calculate probabilities for complex events.

Random Variables: From Sets to Numbers
-----------------------------------------

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A random variable (RV) :math:`X` is a function that maps each outcome 
in the sample space :math:`\omega \in \Omega` to a numerical value. 
Formally, :math:`X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}`.

Why is a Random Variable Needed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Outcomes of random experiments are often multi-faceted and tend to
introduce more complexity than necessary. For example,
suppose we flip a coin 10 times and count how many heads appear
in the sequence. The complete sample 
space of ten coin flips contains :math:`2^{10} = 1,024` different possible sequences. 

However, if we're only interested in the total number of heads, 
we do not need to examine each sequence individually. For instance, 
instead of interpreting 'HHHHHHHHTH' as a unique sequence, we can view 
it simply as an outcome that yields the numerical value 9. 

This is where a random variable becomes useful.
We can define a random variable, say :math:`X`, to map the outcome 'HHHHHHHHTH' to a 
numerical value that reflects the focus of our interest:

.. math:: X('HHHHHHHHTH') = 9,

and all other 1,023 outcomes in a similar manner. By using a random variable, we 
reduced our focus from 1,024 sequences to just 11 possible 
values (0 through 10).

Expressing Events With Random Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the key advantages of introducing a random variable is **conciseness**. 
Once an appropriate random variable is defined,
most events can be expressed as equalities or inequalities involving the variable. 
See the table below for some examples:

.. flat-table::
   :align: center
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 2 2 1

   * - Description
     - Using set notation
     - Using random variable :math:`X`
   
   * - Event that there are three heads in the sequence
     - Define :math:`A_3` as the name of the event. List all sequences
       with three heads in :math:`A_3 = \{\cdots\}`.
     - :math:`X=3`

   * - Event that there are more than 7 heads in the sequence
     - Define :math:`A_8, A_9, A_{10}` as the events of sequences with
       8, 9, and 10 heads, respectively. The event of interest is
       :math:`A_8 \cup A_9 \cup A_{10}`.
     - :math:`X > 7`

We no longer need to define a new event for every new question. Instead, we can 
express various situations compactly using the random variable :math:`X`.

..
   Formally, this notation represents:

   .. math::

      P(X = x) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega \mid X(\omega) = x\})

   This means the probability that X equals some value x is the probability of the set of all outcomes
   ω in the sample space Ω such that when we apply our random variable function X to ω, we get the value x.

Types of Random Variables
-----------------------------

Random variables fall into two main categories based on the nature of their possible values.

Discrete Random Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A random variable is discrete if it can take on only a countable number of possible values. 
Discrete random variables typically arise when **counting** things, such as:

* The number of heads in coin flips
* The number of website hits during a specific time period
* The number of customers until the first big-ticket item is sold

Continuous Random Variables 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A random variable is continuous if it can take on any value within a continuous 
range or interval. Continuous random variables typically arise when **measuring** quantities, 
such as:

* Height, weight, or other physical measurements
* Time until a particular event occurs
* Temperature, pressure, or other environmental measurements

Probability Distributions
----------------------------------------

To describe the probabilistic behavior of a random variable, we must specify 
the probabilities associated with all its possible values. This complete description 
is called a probability distribution.

Discrete and continuous random variables have different types of probability distributions.
Discrete random variables is described by a **probability mass function** (PMF), while a 
continuous random variables is described by  a **probability density function** (PDF).

In this chapter, we will focus on discrete random variables and PMFs. As we progress through the course, 
we will see how PMFs and PDFs share some foundational ideas, while differing 
in important ways.

Probability Mass Functions
------------------------------

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The probability mass function of a discrete random variable :math:`X` is denoted by
:math:`p_X`. For each possible value :math:`x` that :math:`X` can take, it gives

.. math:: p_X(x) = P(X = x).

Different forms of a PMF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PMF can be represented in several different forms. 

1. A PMF can be organized into a **table** by listing the possible values 
   with their corresponding probabilities.

   .. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter5/table-pmf-general.png
      :alt: A table form of PMF
      :align: center
      :figwidth: 60%

      Exapmle of a PMF in table form 

2. A bar graph can visually represent a PMF, with possible values on the x-axis and bar heights indicating 
   their probabilities. However, it is rarely used alone, since exact probabilities are hard to read unless 
   the plot is very simple.

3. For some special random variables, a mathematical formula is used to describe the PMF.
   One example is:

   .. math:: p_X(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!}, \text{ for } x \geq 0

Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **support** of a discrete random variable is the set of all possible values with a positive probability:

.. math::

   \text{supp}(X) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid p_X(x) > 0\}.


Validity of a PMF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a probability mass function to be **valid**, the following conditions must hold.

1. **Non-negativity**: For all :math:`x`, :math:`0 \leq p_X(x) \leq 1.`


2. **Total probability of 1**: The sum of probabilities over all values in the support must equal 1:
   
   .. math:: 
      
      \sum_{x \in \text{supp}(X)} p_X(x) = 1

Important Types of Problems Involving PMFs
------------------------------------------------

A. Constructing a PMF from Scracth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is an important skill for statisticians to be able to
"translate" descriptions of a random experiment in plain language
to mathematical language involving a random variable and its PMF.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Flipping a Biased Coin
   :class: note

   Let us try constructing a PMF from scratch, only using descriptions of
   the experimental setting.

   Suppose we flip a biased coin four times, where the probability of heads on each flip is 0.7 (and tails is 0.3). 
   We define a random variable :math:`H` **to count the number of heads in the four flips**. Find the
   complete PMF for :math:`H`. Verify that the PMF is valid.

   First, let's identify the sample space. There are :math:`2^4 = 16` possible sequences of heads and tails over four 
   flips. However, rather than working with all 16 sequences individually, we can group them based on the 
   number of heads:

   * :math:`H = 0`: Only one sequence has zero heads (all tails: TTTT)
   * :math:`H = 1`: Four sequences have exactly one head (HTTT, THTT, TTHT, TTTH)
   * :math:`H = 2`: Six sequences have exactly two heads
   * :math:`H = 3`: Four sequences have exactly three heads 
   * :math:`H = 4`: Only one sequence has all four heads (HHHH)

   Using the independence of the coin flips and the given probabilities,

   * :math:`P(H = 0) = P(TTTT) = (0.3)^4 = 0.0081`
   * :math:`P(H = 1) = 4 (0.3)^3 (0.7) = 0.0756`
   * :math:`P(H = 2) = 6 (0.3)^2 (0.7)^2 = 0.2646`
   * :math:`P(H = 3) = 4 (0.3) (0.7)^3 = 0.4116`
   * :math:`P(H = 4) = (0.7)^4 = 0.2401`

   All probabilities are betwen 0 and 1, satisfying the first condition for validity.
   The probabilities also sum to 1: 

   .. math:: 0.0081 + 0.0756 + 0.2646 + 0.4116 + 0.2401 = 1.

   This gives us the complete PMF for our random variable :math:`H`.

      Visualization of the PMF for the number of heads in four flips

   The PMF reveals that getting three heads is the most likely outcome, with a probability of approximately 0.41, 
   while getting zero heads is very unlikely, with a probability of only about 0.008.

B. Completing a Partially Known PMF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Completing a partially specified PMF is a common task in statistics. Typical scenarios include:

* One probability in the support is unknown.
* Multiple probabilities are unknown, with additional constraints provided.
* The coefficient :math:`k` that turns a non-negative function :math:`f(x)`
  into a valid PMF :math:`p_X(x) = kf(x)` is unknown. 
  This constant :math:`k` is called the **normalization constant**.

In all cases, we must "fill in the blanks" by applying
the conditions of a valid PMF.

.. admonition:: Example💡:  Finding the Normalization Constant
   :class: note

   Consider a potential PMF:

   .. math::

      p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{k}{16} & \text{for } x = 0, 1 \\
      \frac{k}{32} & \text{for } x = 2, 3, 4 \\
      \frac{k}{64} & \text{for } x = 5, 6\\
      0 & \text{for all other} x
      \end{cases}

   To make this a valid PMF, we need to find the value of k that ensures the probabilities sum to 1:

   .. math::

      \frac{k}{16} + \frac{k}{16} + \frac{k}{32} + \frac{k}{32} + \frac{k}{32} + \frac{k}{64} + \frac{k}{64} = 1

   Multiplying both sides by 64 and solving for :math:`k`,

   .. math::

      &4k + 4k + 2k + 2k + 2k + k + k = 64\\
      &16k = 64 \\
      &k = 4

   Therefore, the valid PMF is:

   .. math::

      p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{1}{4} & \text{for } x = 0, 1 \\
      \frac{1}{8} & \text{for } x = 2, 3, 4 \\
      \frac{1}{16} & \text{for } x = 5, 6\\
      0 & \text{for all other} x
      \end{cases}

C. Calculating Probabilities with PMFs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once we have a complete PMF, we can calculate probabilities for various events 
related to the random variable.

Viewing events as equalities and inequalities involving a random variable,
we can express probablities of unions, intersections, and complements 
concisely in terms of :math:`p_X(x)`. Let us first get some practice
writing proability statements correctly in terms of :math:`X`. 

**Example**: Consider a random variable :math:`X` whose support consists of **all positive integers**. 

.. flat-table::
   :header-rows: 2
   :align: center
   :widths: 1 2 2

   * - :cspan:`2` Probability statements for discrete RV :math:`X` with a positive support

   * - Description 
     - Expresssion in terms of :math:`p_X(x)`
     - Comment

   * - Probability that X is less than 4
     - .. math:: 

          &P(X < 4) \\
          &= P(X=1 \text{ OR } X=2 \text{ OR } X=3) \\
          &= P(X=1 \cup X=2 \cup X=3)\\
          &= P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3)\\
          &= p_X(1) + p_X(2) + p_X(3)
     - The transition from the third to the fourth line works because
       the events :math:`\{X=x\}` are **disjoint** for different values of :math:`x`
       (See the special addition rule).
   
   * - Probability that X is less than 4 **and** at least 2
     - .. math:: 
          &P(X < 4 \cap X \geq 2)\\ 
          &= P(2 \leq X < 4)\\
          & = p_X(2) + p_X(3)
     - For intersections and unions of non-disjoint events, think of ways to combine
       the two separate (in)equalities into one. 

   * - Probability that X is at least than 4 **or** greater than 6
     - .. math::
          &P(X4 \geq \cup X>6) \\
          &= P(X \geq 4) \\
          &= 1 - P(X < 4)
     - To compute :math:`P(X \geq 4)` directly, we would have to sum
       infinitely many terms. The complement rule simplifies computation.

Now, let us apply these skills to solve a problem.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Computing probabilities using PMF
   :class: note

   Using the PMF we just derived, let's calculate some probabilities.

   .. math::

      p_X(x) = \begin{cases}
      \frac{1}{4} & \text{for } x = 0, 1 \\
      \frac{1}{8} & \text{for } x = 2, 3, 4 \\
      \frac{1}{16} & \text{for } x = 5, 6\\
      0 & \text{for all other} x
      \end{cases}

   1. The probability that X is even: 
      
      .. math:: 

         P(X \text{ is even}) &= P(X = 0) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 6) \\
         &= 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 9/16

   2. The probability that X is greater than 3:
      
      .. math:: 
         
         P(X > 3) &= P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) \\
         &= 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 1/4

   3. Are the events :math:`\{X = 5 or X = 6\}` and :math:`\{X > 3\}` **independent**?

      To show independence between two events :math:`A` and :math:`B`,
      we must **show that they meet the mathematical definition** of idependence. That is,
      we must verify :math:`P(A|B) = P(A)` or :math:`P(B|A)P(A).`
      
      .. math::

         P(X = 5 \text{ or } X = 6 | X > 3) &= \frac{P((X = 5 \cup X = 6) \cap (X > 3))}{P(X > 3)}\\
         &= \frac{P(X = 5 \cup X = 6)}{P(X > 3)}\\
         &= (1/16 + 1/16)/(1/4) = 1/2\\
         P(X = 5 \cup X = 6) &= 1/16 + 1/16 = 1/8
      
      Since :math:`1/2 \neq 1/8`, these events are not independent.

Bringing It All Together
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **Random variables** map outcomes from the sample space to numerical values, allowing 
      us to focus on quantities of interest rather than complex sets.
   
   2. **Discrete random variables** take on countable values and are typically used when 
      counting things, while **continuous random variables** can take any value in a continuum 
      and are used for measurements.
   
   3. A **probability mass function (PMF)** specifies the probability that a discrete random 
      variable equals each possible value in its support.
   
   4. Valid PMFs must satisfy two conditions: 
      
      (1) all probabilities are between 0 and 1, and 
      (2) the sum of all probabilities equals 1.
   
   5. We can calculate probabilities for various events by rewriting the probability 
      statements in terms of the PMF.

      **Part (b): P(at least one retransmission)**

      "At least one retransmission" means :math:`X \geq 1`:

      .. math::

         P(X \geq 1) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)

      .. math::

         P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60

      **Part (c): P(more than 2 retransmissions)**

      "More than 2" means :math:`X > 2`, i.e., :math:`X = 3` or :math:`X = 4`:

         P(X > 2) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15

.. admonition:: Exercise 4: Finding the Normalization Constant
   :class: note

   A data scientist models the number of daily user complaints :math:`X` on a support forum. The PMF is proposed to be:

   .. math::

      p_X(x) = k \cdot (0.6)^x \quad \text{for } x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

   where :math:`k` is a normalization constant.

   a. Find the value of :math:`k` that makes this a valid PMF.

   b. Calculate :math:`P(X \leq 2)`.

   c. Calculate :math:`P(X \geq 1)`.

   d. Calculate :math:`P(1 \leq X \leq 3)`.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Finding k**

      First, compute the sum :math:`\sum_{x=0}^{4} (0.6)^x`:

      .. math::

         (0.6)^0 + (0.6)^1 + (0.6)^2 + (0.6)^3 + (0.6)^4 = 1 + 0.6 + 0.36 + 0.216 + 0.1296 = 2.3056

      For validity, we need:

      .. math::

         k \cdot 2.3056 = 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{2.3056} \approx 0.4337

      **Part (b): P(X ≤ 2)**

      .. math::

         P(X \leq 2) = p_X(0) + p_X(1) + p_X(2)

      .. math::

         = k(1 + 0.6 + 0.36) = k(1.96) = \frac{1.96}{2.3056} \approx 0.8501

      **Part (c): P(X ≥ 1)**

      Using complement rule:

      .. math::

         P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - k \cdot (0.6)^0 = 1 - k = 1 - \frac{1}{2.3056} \approx 0.5663

      **Part (d): P(1 ≤ X ≤ 3)**

      .. math::

         P(1 \leq X \leq 3) = p_X(1) + p_X(2) + p_X(3)

      .. math::

         = k(0.6 + 0.36 + 0.216) = k(1.176) = \frac{1.176}{2.3056} \approx 0.5101

      **Part (a): Not Valid** ✗

      Check sum: :math:`\frac{1}{10} + \frac{2}{10} + \frac{3}{10} + \frac{4}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1` ✓

      Check non-negativity: All values :math:`\frac{1}{10}, \frac{2}{10}, \frac{3}{10}, \frac{4}{10}` are between 0 and 1 ✓

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): P(X < 2)**

      .. math::

         P(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75

      **Part (b): P(X ≥ 2)**

      Using complement rule:

      .. math::

         P(X \geq 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25

      Or directly: :math:`P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = 0.15 + 0.07 + 0.03 = 0.25` ✓

      **Part (c): P(1 ≤ X ≤ 3)**

      .. math::

         P(1 \leq X \leq 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.07 = 0.47

      **Part (d): P(Grade B)**

      Grade B means :math:`X \in \{1, 2\}`:

      .. math::

         P(\text{Grade B}) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.40

      **Part (e): P(Grade B | Not Grade A)**

      "Not Grade A" means :math:`X \geq 1`:

      .. math::

         P(\text{Grade B} | X \geq 1) = \frac{P(\text{Grade B} \cap X \geq 1)}{P(X \geq 1)}

      Since Grade B ⊆ (X ≥ 1):

      .. math::

         = \frac{P(\text{Grade B})}{P(X \geq 1)} = \frac{0.40}{0.50} = 0.80

      Given a component is not Grade A, there's an 80% chance it's Grade B.

      **Part (f): Independence Check**

      Let A = "Grade A" = :math:`\{X = 0\}` and E = "X is even" = :math:`\{X = 0, 2, 4\}`

      Calculate:

      - :math:`P(A) = P(X = 0) = 0.50`
      - :math:`P(E) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 4) = 0.50 + 0.15 + 0.03 = 0.68`
      - :math:`P(A \cap E) = P(X = 0) = 0.50` (since :math:`\{X = 0\} \cap \{X \text{ even}\} = \{X = 0\}`)

      Check: :math:`P(A) \cdot P(E) = 0.50 \times 0.68 = 0.34`

      Since :math:`P(A \cap E) = 0.50 \neq 0.34 = P(A) \cdot P(E)`, **the events are NOT independent**.

      **Intuition**: If X = 0 (Grade A), we're certain X is even. But if X were just some value in the support, there's only a 68% chance it's even. Knowing it's Grade A increases the probability of "even" from 68% to 100%.

   **True/False Answers:**

   1. **True** — By definition, a random variable :math:`X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}` maps each outcome ω in the sample space to a real number.

   2. **False** — Counting customers yields whole numbers (0, 1, 2, ...), making it a **discrete** random variable. Discrete RVs arise from counting; continuous RVs arise from measuring.

   3. **True** — The support is defined as :math:`\text{supp}(X) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : p_X(x) > 0\}`, exactly those values with positive probability.

   4. **True** — This is one of the two validity conditions for a PMF: :math:`\sum_{x \in \text{supp}(X)} p_X(x) = 1`.

   5. **False** — Sum check: :math:`4 \times 0.3 = 1.2 \neq 1`. The probabilities sum to more than 1, violating the normalization condition.

   6. **True** — These events are not mutually exclusive. For example, if :math:`\text{supp}(X) = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}`, both :math:`P(X = 5)` and :math:`P(X < 5)` can be positive simultaneously.

   **Multiple Choice Answers:**

   7. **Ⓒ** — Sum: :math:`k(0+1) + k(1+1) + k(2+1) + k(3+1) = k(1+2+3+4) = 10k = 1`, so :math:`k = 1/10`.

   8. **Ⓒ** — :math:`P(X > 3) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 4/15 + 5/15 = 9/15 = 3/5`.

   9. **Ⓓ** — Check each:
      - (A): :math:`4 \times 1/4 = 1` ✓
      - (B): :math:`1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 = 1` ✓

      - (D): :math:`3 \times 0.5 = 1.5 \neq 1` ✗

   10. **Ⓐ** — Since :math:`P(X \leq 3) = P(X \leq 2) + P(X = 3)`, we have :math:`P(X = 3) = 0.7 - 0.5 = 0.2`.
