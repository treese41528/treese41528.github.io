Overview
-------------------------------------------------
This document is a comprehensive reference for the **primary R tools** used in STAT 350. It introduces R and RStudio, outlines the workflow we use in class, and provides an **enhanced reference** to the functions, libraries, and plotting layers that appear across the computer assignments and worksheets. The emphasis is on: loading data; validating and cleaning; visualizing; computing summaries; fitting models; **checking assumptions**; and performing inference with well-annotated code.

Use this as a companion to the assignment tutorials (linked below).
