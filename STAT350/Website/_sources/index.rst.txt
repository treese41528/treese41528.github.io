STAT 350: Introduction to Statistics
=====================================

A data-oriented introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods
of applied statistics. Exploratory analysis of data. Sample design and experimental design.
Probability distributions and simulation. Sampling distributions. The reasoning of statistical
inference. Confidence intervals and tests for one and two samples. Inference for regression,
and correlation. Essential use is made of statistical software throughout. This course is
designed for students that are required to perform statistical analysis in their disciplines.
This course assumes a prerequisite of Calculus 2 (integration). Throughout the course, you will
need to demonstrate your ability to perform integrations both in homework assignments and
exams. While we may cover more advanced concepts, it's important to note that the
assessment will not extend beyond a Calculus 2 level of difficulty.

While mathematical concepts are present in this course, its focus lies on developing critical
thinking skills. Understanding the underlying reasons behind concepts is emphasized before
learning how to apply them. This approach aims to empower you to make informed decisions
both professionally and personally, fostering wisdom and sound judgment. By prioritizing the
"why" over the "how," the course ensures a deeper comprehension of the material, enabling you
to apply statistical principles more effectively in real-world scenarios.
