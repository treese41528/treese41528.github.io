Interactive Learning Tools
--------------------------

In addition to the webbook and video platform, you have access to browser-based tools designed to support your learning in this intensive format:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 0

   * - **Interactive Simulators**
     - Browser-based visualizations for the Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, and power analysis. Experiment with sampling distributions and see concepts in action—no R installation required. `Open CLT Simulator <https://treese41528.github.io/STAT350/ShinyApps/CLT.html>`_
   * - **Statistical Procedures Tool**
     - An interactive decision flowchart for choosing the correct statistical method based on your research question and data type. Use this as a study aid when reviewing for exams. `Open Procedures Tool <https://treese41528.github.io/STAT350/StatisticsProcedures.html>`_
   * - **AI Course Assistant (Beta)**
     - A chatbot trained on all STAT 350 course materials that can answer conceptual questions, point you to relevant webbook sections, and help clarify confusing topics. Available 24/7. `Open AI Assistant <https://advert-cingular-employer-humor.trycloudflare.com/>`_

.. admonition:: About the AI Course Assistant
   :class: note

   This tool is currently in **beta testing**. You may occasionally encounter incomplete answers, unexpected behavior, or temporary unavailability. Use it as you would a tutor—for explanation and clarification—not as a replacement for doing the work yourself. 
   
   **Report any issues** (incorrect information, broken features, confusing responses) to Dr. Reese via email so the tool can be improved.
   
   **Remember**: The AI assistant will not be available during exams. Students who rely on AI as a crutch rather than a learning tool consistently perform poorly on proctored assessments.


STAT 350: Introduction to Statistics - Winter Session 2025
===========================================================

**Intensive Asynchronous Online | December 22, 2025 - January 9, 2026**

Welcome to the **Winter offering of STAT 350**! This is an intensive experience—fitting a full 16-week course into just **11 days** (9 instructional days plus 2 exam days). Statistics isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about understanding uncertainty and making well-informed decisions based on evidence.

.. admonition:: Critical Notice
   :class: important

   This Winter session compresses an entire semester into eleven days. **Treat it like a full-time internship**: plan on **at least 8 focused hours every instructional day**. Falling behind even one day makes it nearly impossible to catch up. Success requires self-reliance, proactivity, and daily engagement.

Why This Course? Why Now?
--------------------------

We live in an era dominated by data. Every decision—from public health policies to business strategies—depends on accurate statistical reasoning.

- **Critical decision-making**: Statistics is the backbone of research and industry. Incorrect interpretation can have serious real-world consequences.
- **Understanding uncertainty**: Life is unpredictable. Statistical methods help you quantify, understand, and communicate uncertainty clearly.
- **The backbone of AI and machine learning**: All modern AI models rely heavily on probability theory and statistical modeling—critical skills for the future workforce.

Winter Session Format
---------------------

**What makes this different:**

- **9 instructional days** covering 13 chapters of material
- **Daily cycle**: Absorb → Apply → Assess → Review (~8-10 hours/day)
- **2 proctored exams**: Midterm (Day 6) and Final (Day 11)
- **No makeup opportunities**: The accelerated pace leaves no buffer for catching up
