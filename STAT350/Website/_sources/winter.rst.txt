STAT 350: Introduction to Statistics - Winter Session 2025
===========================================================

**Intensive Asynchronous Online | December 22, 2025 - January 9, 2026**

Welcome to the **Winter offering of STAT 350**! This is an intensive experience‚Äîfitting a full 16-week course into just **11 days** (9 instructional days plus 2 exam days). Statistics isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about understanding uncertainty and making well-informed decisions based on evidence.

.. admonition:: Critical Notice
   :class: important

   This Winter session compresses an entire semester into eleven days. **Treat it like a full-time internship**: plan on **at least 8 focused hours every instructional day**. Falling behind even one day makes it nearly impossible to catch up. Success requires self-reliance, proactivity, and daily engagement.

Why This Course? Why Now?
--------------------------

We live in an era dominated by data. Every decision‚Äîfrom public health policies to business strategies‚Äîdepends on accurate statistical reasoning.

- **Critical decision-making**: Statistics is the backbone of research and industry. Incorrect interpretation can have serious real-world consequences.
- **Understanding uncertainty**: Life is unpredictable. Statistical methods help you quantify, understand, and communicate uncertainty clearly.
- **The backbone of AI and machine learning**: All modern AI models rely heavily on probability theory and statistical modeling‚Äîcritical skills for the future workforce.

Winter Session Format
---------------------

**What makes this different:**

- **9 instructional days** covering 13 chapters of material
- **Daily cycle**: Absorb ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Assess ‚Üí Review (~8-10 hours/day)
- **2 proctored exams**: Midterm (Day 6) and Final (Day 11)
- **No makeup opportunities**: The accelerated pace leaves no buffer for catching up

Your Daily Learning Cycle
--------------------------

**1. Absorb (‚âà2-4 hours)**
   - Complete assigned reading in the free digital webbook
   - Watch segmented lecture videos using the Video Learning Platform
   - Use search bar and timeline to target challenging topics

**2. Apply (‚âà2-4 hours)**
   - Work through Edfinity homework on scratch paper first
   - You have **10 attempts** with instant feedback‚Äîuse them to learn, not guess
   - Complete computer assignments using R
   - Record steps that slow you down for exam review

**3. Assess (‚âà20 minutes)**
   - Take the timed daily quiz in Brightspace (one attempt only)
   - Quizzes focus on conceptual understanding, mirroring exam questions

**4. Review (‚âà1 hour)**
   - Check posted solutions
   - Revisit video segments on challenging topics
   - Post or answer questions on the peer discussion board

.. admonition:: Success Tips
   :class: tip

   - **Use the Video Platform strategically**: Search for specific topics, use micro-lectures for quick review
   - **Leverage peer support**: Your classmates are your best resource for immediate help
   - **Don't rely heavily on AI**: Students who use AI as a crutch consistently perform poorly on exams
   - **Plan for limited instructor response**: Email replies may take 24-48 hours; plan questions accordingly

Exam Requirements: Respondus LockDown Browser
----------------------------------------------

Both the **Midterm (Day 6 - December 31)** and **Final Exam (Day 11 - January 9)** are proctored online using **Respondus LockDown Browser with webcam monitoring**. This system ensures exam integrity by restricting your computer to only the exam while monitoring you through your webcam.

.. admonition:: WATCH THIS VIDEO BEFORE STARTING THE COURSE

   Failure to prepare your testing environment properly may prevent you from taking the exam, and **there are no makeup opportunities** in this winter session.

**What is Respondus LockDown Browser?**

- Your webcam records you throughout the entire exam session
- Your screen is recorded to detect any unauthorized activity
- You cannot print, copy, access other applications, or use virtual machines
- The software includes a built-in scientific calculator for your use

**Required Equipment:**

- Understanding concepts *after* reading textbook/watching lectures
- R coding assistance (debugging, syntax) *after* attempting code yourself

**Prohibited:**

- Generating complete solutions to homework or assignments
- Submitting AI-generated content as your own
- Using AI during exams (this is academic misconduct)
