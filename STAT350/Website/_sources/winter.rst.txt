STAT 350: Introduction to Statistics - Winter Session 2025
===========================================================

**Intensive Asynchronous Online | December 22, 2025 - January 9, 2026**

Welcome to the **Winter offering of STAT 350**! This is an intensive experience—fitting a full 16-week course into just **11 days** (9 instructional days plus 2 exam days). Statistics isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about understanding uncertainty and making well-informed decisions based on evidence.

.. admonition:: Critical Notice
   :class: important

   This Winter session compresses an entire semester into eleven days. **Treat it like a full-time internship**: plan on **at least 8 focused hours every instructional day**. Falling behind even one day makes it nearly impossible to catch up. Success requires self-reliance, proactivity, and daily engagement.

Why This Course? Why Now?
--------------------------

We live in an era dominated by data. Every decision—from public health policies to business strategies—depends on accurate statistical reasoning.

- **Critical decision-making**: Statistics is the backbone of research and industry. Incorrect interpretation can have serious real-world consequences.
- **Understanding uncertainty**: Life is unpredictable. Statistical methods help you quantify, understand, and communicate uncertainty clearly.
- **The backbone of AI and machine learning**: All modern AI models rely heavily on probability theory and statistical modeling—critical skills for the future workforce.

Winter Session Format
---------------------

**What makes this different:**

- **9 instructional days** covering 13 chapters of material
- **Daily cycle**: Absorb → Apply → Assess → Review (~8-10 hours/day)
- **2 proctored exams**: Midterm (Day 6) and Final (Day 11)
- **No makeup opportunities**: The accelerated pace leaves no buffer for catching up

Your Daily Learning Cycle
--------------------------

**1. Absorb (≈2-4 hours)**
   - Complete assigned reading in the free digital webbook
   - Watch segmented lecture videos using the Video Learning Platform
   - Use search bar and timeline to target challenging topics

**2. Apply (≈2-4 hours)**
   - Work through Edfinity homework on scratch paper first
   - You have **10 attempts** with instant feedback—use them to learn, not guess
   - Complete computer assignments using R
   - Record steps that slow you down for exam review

**3. Assess (≈20 minutes)**
   - Take the timed daily quiz in Brightspace (one attempt only)
   - Quizzes focus on conceptual understanding, mirroring exam questions

**4. Review (≈1 hour)**
   - Check posted solutions
   - Revisit video segments on challenging topics
   - Post or answer questions on the peer discussion board

.. admonition:: Success Tips
   :class: tip

   - **Start early**: The course opens before December 22—begin working ahead
   - **Log in every morning**: Check deadlines and announcements daily
   - **Use the Video Platform strategically**: Search for specific topics, use micro-lectures for quick review
   - **Leverage peer support**: Your classmates are your best resource for immediate help
   - **Don't rely heavily on AI**: Students who use AI as a crutch consistently perform poorly on exams
   - **Plan for limited instructor response**: Email replies may take 24-48 hours; plan questions accordingly

Exam Requirements: Respondus LockDown Browser
----------------------------------------------

Both the **Midterm (Day 6 - December 31)** and **Final Exam (Day 11 - January 9)** are proctored online using **Respondus LockDown Browser with webcam monitoring**. This system ensures exam integrity by restricting your computer to only the exam while monitoring you through your webcam.

.. admonition:: WATCH THIS VIDEO BEFORE STARTING THE COURSE
   :class: important

   **You must watch this setup video to ensure you meet all exam requirements:**
   
   .. raw:: html

      </div>
   
   Failure to prepare your testing environment properly may prevent you from taking the exam, and **there are no makeup opportunities** in this winter session.

**What is Respondus LockDown Browser?**

Respondus LockDown Browser is a custom browser that locks down the testing environment within Brightspace. When you launch the exam:

- Your computer is locked to the exam application only—you cannot access other programs, websites, or files
- Your webcam records you throughout the entire exam session
- Your screen is recorded to detect any unauthorized activity
- You cannot print, copy, access other applications, or use virtual machines
- The software includes a built-in scientific calculator for your use

**Required Equipment:**

.. list-table::

   :header-rows: 0

   * - **Computer**
     - Desktop or laptop (Windows or macOS). **Tablets and Chromebooks are NOT supported**
   * - **Webcam**
     - Working webcam that shows **both your face and writing area**. Most laptop webcams are not wide enough—you may need an external USB webcam
   * - **Microphone**
     - Working microphone for audio recording
   * - **Internet**
     - Stable connection of at least 2 Mbps (test at speedtest.net)

**How Exams Work:**

1. **24-hour window**: Each exam is available for a 24-hour period to accommodate different schedules
2. **Fixed time limit**: Once you begin, you have a set time (80 min for midterm, 140 min for final)
3. **One attempt only**: You cannot pause, exit, or restart the exam
4. **Identity verification**: Show your ID to the webcam at the start
5. **Continuous monitoring**: Your webcam and screen record throughout
6. **Automatic submission**: Exam auto-submits when time expires

**Technical Requirements:**

**Practice Run - DO THIS BEFORE THE MIDTERM:**

Brightspace will have a **practice quiz using LockDown Browser** available before the first exam. **Complete this practice session** to:

- Test your webcam and microphone
- Verify your internet connection is sufficient
- Practice the identity verification process
- Familiarize yourself with the exam interface
- Identify any technical issues before exam day

.. admonition:: Critical Exam Preparation Timeline
   :class: important

   **At least 3 days before Midterm (by December 28):**
   
   1. Download and install Respondus LockDown Browser
   2. Complete the practice quiz to test your full setup
   3. Verify your webcam shows both face and desk area
   4. Ensure you have a government ID available
   5. Prepare your testing environment (clear desk, good lighting, quiet room)
   6. If you encounter any issues, contact instructor immediately
   
   **Remember**: The midterm is on December 31. Technical support may be limited. Do not wait until exam day to discover equipment problems.

**What Happens if I Have Technical Issues?**

- **Before the exam**: Email the instructor immediately if you discover equipment or software problems
- **During the exam**: If you experience a technical failure, document it immediately and contact the instructor as soon as possible
- **No makeup exams**: Technical issues on your end do not guarantee a makeup opportunity in this compressed format

**Academic Integrity:**

The webcam monitoring system flags suspicious behaviors including:

- Looking away from the screen frequently
- Talking or moving your lips (suggesting communication)
- Leaving the camera view
- Multiple people detected in the room
- Use of unauthorized materials
- Unusual background noise

All recordings are reviewed. Academic misconduct will result in serious consequences including failing the course and referral to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.

Communication & Support
-----------------------

**Instructor:** Dr. Timothy Reese | reese18@purdue.edu | MATH 210

- **Email**: Use subject line "STAT 350: <topic>". Expect 24-48 hour response time, potentially longer on weekends/holidays
- **Peer Discussion Board**: "Q&A for Peers" on Brightspace—your quickest help resource. Instructor will not monitor regularly.

.. admonition:: Peer Support is Essential
   :class: tip

   In this accelerated format, your classmates are critical to your success. Build connections early, participate actively in discussions, and help each other. Students who engage with peers perform significantly better.

AI Usage Policy
---------------

AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) may be used according to these guidelines:

**Permitted:**

- Checking reasoning or getting hints *after* attempting problems yourself
- Understanding concepts *after* reading textbook/watching lectures
- R coding assistance (debugging, syntax) *after* attempting code yourself

**Prohibited:**

- Generating complete solutions to homework or assignments
