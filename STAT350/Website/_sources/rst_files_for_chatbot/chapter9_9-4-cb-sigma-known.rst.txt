Confidence Bounds for the Poulation Mean When σ is Known
=============================================================

Confidence intervals provide two boundaries that define a plausible range for the true parameter. 
When the **practical interest lies primarily in one direction**, however, 
**one-sided confidence bounds** offer a more context-appropriate and precise approach. 
Their logic and derivation follow the same principles as those of two-sided intervals, 
but they differ in how the probability of error is allocated.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important
   
   * **Recognize the situations** in which using a one-sided confidence bound may
     be more precise and cost-efficient than a confidence interval.
   * **Derive a confidence bound** using principles parallel to those used in constructing confidence intervals,
     and apply the result to practice.

Why One‑Sided Bounds?
-----------------------

Two-sided confidence intervals aim to capture the unknown population mean :math:`\mu` on both sides of the point estimator 
:math:`\bar{X}`. However, many scientific questions call 
for a **directional guarantee**. For example:

* In certain safety assessemnts, the mean toxin level must **not exceed** a legal limit.
* The average tensile strength must be **at least** a promised specification to pass a quality control test.
* A component's mean time to failure must be **greater than** a minimum benchmark.
* A drug's efficacy must be **above** a specified threshold.

In these situations, a one-sided confidence bound is not only more directly aligned with the research question 
but also provides a **more precise** bound than the interval at the same confidence level.

Deriving the Upper Confidence Bound
-------------------------------------

The Goal
~~~~~~~~~~

For an **upper** confidence bound, we are only concerned with the guarantee that
the population mean :math:`\mu` is **below** a certain threshold. That is,
for a pre-specified confidence coefficient :math:`C` between 0 and 1, we would like to 
find an upper bound of the form :math:`\bar{X} + ME` such that

.. math::
   P\left(\mu < \bar{X} + ME \right) = C.

Preliminaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The language used in deriving confidence bounds overlaps significantly with
that of confidence intervals.

* The probability :math:`C` is called the **confidence coefficient** and its conversion
  to percentage is called the **confidence level**.
* :math:`\alpha = 1 - C`. 
* A :math:`z`-**critical value** :math:`z_\alpha` marks the location on the standard normal pdf 
  whose upper area is :math:`\alpha`.

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter9/CB-critical-value-labeled.png
   :alt: Standard normal curve displaying one-sided critical region
   :figwidth: 90%
   :align: center

Note that :math:`z_\alpha` also satisfies :math:`P(Z < z_\alpha) = C`.

The Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The assumptions required for validity of the construction is identical to the two-sided case:

1. :math:`X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n` form an *iid* sample from the population, :math:`X`.
   The expected value and variance of :math:`X` is denoted :math:`\mu` and :math:`\sigma^2`,
   respectively.
2. Either the population is normally distributed, or we have sufficiently large :math:`n`
   for the CLT to hold.
3. The population variance :math:`\sigma^2` is known.

It follows that the pivotal quantity has the standard normal distribution:

.. math::
   \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0,1).

The Derivation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We begin with the property of :math:`z_\alpha` which holds by its definition:

.. math::
   P(Z < z_\alpha) = C.

1. Replace :math:`Z` with the pivotal quanity:

   .. math::
      P\left(\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} < z_{\alpha}\right) = C

2. Multiply both sides by :math:`\sigma/\sqrt{n}`:

   .. math::
      P\left(\bar{X}-\mu < z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = C

3. Subtract :math:`\bar{X}` from both sides and multiply by -1 (which reverses the inequality):

   .. math::
      P\left(\mu < \bar{X} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = C

This gives us a probability statement with the same structure as our goal.


.. admonition:: Derive the lower confidence bound as an independent exercise 🤔
   :class: important 

   For lower confidence bounds, we are looking for a guarantee that the population
   mean :math:`\mu` is **above** a threshold with a high probability :math:`C`.
   Since it bounds :math:`\mu` from below, it will take the general form :math:`\bar{X}-ME`.
   Follow the same flow of logic under the same assumptions, making sure to reflect
   the change in direction.

Summary
~~~~~~~~~~

The **upper confidence bound (UCB)** for an observed mean (lower case :math:`\bar{x}`) is: 

.. math::
      \bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

The **lower confidence bound (LCB)** for an observed mean is: 

.. math::
   \bar{x} - z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

.. admonition:: An Interval Representation of Confidence Bounds
   :class: important

   Confidence bounds are sometimes represented as *intervals* with one endpoint extending to infinity.
   The respective interval representations of upper and lower confidence bounds are:

   .. math::
      \left(-\infty, \quad \bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right]
      \quad \text{and} \quad
      \left[\bar{x} - z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\quad \infty\right)


.. admonition:: Example💡: Lead Content in Drinking Water
   :class: note

   An environmental agency samples :math:`n = 40` water taps in a neighborhood. Laboratory analysis 
   reports a sample mean lead concentration of :math:`\bar{x} = 12.7` ppb (parts per billion). 
   Historical data suggest the population standard deviation is :math:`\sigma = 4.5` ppb. The Environmental 
   Protection Agency (EPA) action level for lead in drinking water is :math:`15` ppb.

   Using 95% confidence level, construct the appropriate confidence region to answer the question: 
   "Is the mean lead level in this neighborhood safely below the 
   EPA action limit?" 

   **Which confidence region is appropriate?**

   The goal is to establish an **upper boundary** which marks a safe zone for the true mean
   lead concentration level. We will construct a 95% upper confidence bound.

   **The building blocks**

   * :math:`\sigma = 4.5`
   * :math:`n=40`
   * :math:`\alpha = 1-C = 0.05`
   
   **Step 1:** Compute the critical value
   
   .. math::
      z_{0.05} = 1.645

   This result can be obtained by running ``qnorm(0.05, lower.tail=FALSE)`` on R.

   **Step 2:** Calculate the margin of error

   .. math::
      \text{ME} = z_{0.05} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.645 \frac{4.5}{\sqrt{40}} \approx 1.17 \text{ ppb}

   **Step 3:** Determine the upper bound

   .. math::
      \text{UCB} = \bar{x} + \text{ME} = 12.7 + 1.17 = 13.87 \text{ ppb}

   **Interpretation:** We are 95% confident that the true mean lead level in the neighborhood 
   is below 13.87 ppb, which is less than the EPA action limit of 15 ppb. 
   This provides statistical evidence that the neighborhood's water supply is in 
   compliance with EPA standards.

Comparison of Confidence Intervals and Bounds
------------------------------------------------

It is important to note that a confidence bound **does not coincide** with either 
endpoint of the confidence interval at the same confidence level. The table below summarizes
the key differences:

.. flat-table::
   :width: 100%
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Confidence Interval
     - Confidence Bound
  
   * - **Critical value**
     - :math:`z_{\alpha/2}`
     - :math:`z_\alpha`

   * - **Margin of error**
     - :math:`z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}`
     - :math:`z_{\alpha}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}`
   
   * - **Size of ME**
     - Always greater than CB
     - Always smaller than CI

The size difference in the MEs arises naturally from the definitions of their critical values.
:math:`z_\alpha` must leave out an area twice as large as :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` in the
upper region of the standard normal pdf. Therefore, it must locate itself closer to 0, resulting in a smaller
value than :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` (:numref:`comparing-cv`).

.. _comparing-cv:
.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter9/critical-values-comparison-labeled.png 
   :figwidth: 70%
   :align: center 
   :alt: Comparison of alpha and alpha/2 critical values on a standard normal pdf

   Comparison of critical values for :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\alpha/2`

The table below compares the computed values of :math:`z_\alpha` and :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` for several
commonly used :math:`C= 1-\alpha`:

.. flat-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Confidence Level
     - One-sided :math:`z_{\alpha}`
     - Two-sided :math:`z_{\alpha/2}`

   * - 90%
     - 1.282
     - 1.645

   * - 95%
     - 1.645
     - 1.960

   * - 99%
     - 2.326
     - 2.576

This means that under identical experimental conditions (:math:`C, \sigma`, and :math:`n`), a confidence bound
will always provide a more precise result than a confidence interval on the side of interest. 
By concentrating the available 
resources on a single side rather than splitting them between both bounds, a confidence bound 
achieves greater efficiency whenever applicable.

Choosing Between Bounds and Intervals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The choice between a one-sided bound and a two-sided interval should be made **based on the scientific 
question**, not on which approach gives more favorable results. You may use the guidelines below.

* **Match the research question**: Use one-sided bounds when the research question naturally has a 
  directional component.
  
* **Avoid post-hoc selection**: Make the decision before collecting or analyzing any data.
  Choosing the most favorable confidence region after evaluating all 
  possible candidates undermines the validity of the stated confidence level.

Bringing It All Together
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   * **One-sided confidence bounds** are appropriate when the research question involves a 
     directional concern about a parameter.
   * An **upper confidence bound (UCB)** :math:`\bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` 
     provides a value that the parameter likely falls below.
   * A **lower confidence bound (LCB)** :math:`\bar{x} - z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` 
     provides a value that the parameter likely exceeds.
   * One-sided bounds use **different critical values** from two-sided intervals at the same 
     confidence level.
   * The type of confidence region must be chosen to align with the research question, 
     before collecting and analyzing the data.

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. A battery manufacturer wants to ensure that the mean battery life exceeds :math:`40` hours. 
   A sample of :math:`25` batteries has a mean life of :math:`42.3` hours. 
   Assuming :math:`\sigma = 5` hours is known 
   from extensive testing, construct an appropriate 95% confidence region for the mean battery life
   and formally interpret the reuslt. Does this provide evidence that the mean exceeds :math:`40` hours?

2. Environmental regulations require that the mean concentration of a pollutant in factory 
   discharge not exceed :math:`3.5` ppm. A random sample of :math:`36` discharge measurements yields 
   :math:`\bar{x} = 3.2` ppm. If :math:`\sigma = 0.8` ppm, construct an appropriate 99% confidence region
   and formally interpret the result. Does the factory appear to be in compliance?

   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**:

   .. math::
      UCB = \bar{x} + z_{\alpha} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}

   Interpretation: We are :math:`C\%` confident that :math:`\mu \leq UCB`.

   **Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)**:

Exercises
---------

.. admonition:: Exercise 1: UCB vs LCB Selection
   :class: note

   For each scenario, determine whether an **upper confidence bound (UCB)**, **lower confidence bound (LCB)**, or **two-sided CI** is most appropriate. Explain your reasoning.

   a. An environmental agency wants to verify that mean pollutant levels do not exceed a safety threshold.

   b. A battery manufacturer wants to demonstrate that mean battery life meets a minimum specification.

   c. A researcher is estimating mean blood pressure with no directional hypothesis.

   d. A pharmaceutical company must show that mean drug concentration does not drop below a therapeutic level.

   e. An engineer wants to ensure mean component weight does not exceed a design limit.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): UCB**

      The concern is that pollutant levels might be *too high*. An UCB provides confidence that the true mean is at most some value. If UCB < threshold, compliance is demonstrated.

      **Part (b): LCB**

      The concern is that battery life might be *too low*. An LCB provides confidence that the true mean is at least some value. If LCB > minimum spec, the specification is met.

      **Part (c): Two-sided CI**

      No directional concern—we simply want to estimate the mean with precision on both sides.

      **Part (d): LCB**

      The concern is that concentration might be *too low* (below therapeutic level). An LCB showing the mean is at least the therapeutic level demonstrates efficacy.

      **Part (e): UCB**

      The concern is weight might be *too high*. An UCB provides confidence that mean weight is at most some value.

      **Rule of thumb**: 
      - "At most" / "does not exceed" / "below threshold" → UCB
      - "At least" / "meets minimum" / "above threshold" → LCB
      - No directional interest → Two-sided CI

.. admonition:: Exercise 2: Computing Critical Values
   :class: note

   Find the appropriate critical value for each scenario. Specify whether you use :math:`z_{\alpha}` or :math:`z_{\alpha/2}`.

   a. 95% confidence interval (two-sided)

   b. 95% upper confidence bound (one-sided)

   c. 95% lower confidence bound (one-sided)

   d. 99% confidence interval (two-sided)

   e. 90% upper confidence bound (one-sided)

   f. Explain why the critical value for a 95% UCB is smaller than for a 95% CI.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): 95% CI (two-sided)**

      Use :math:`z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.960`

      **Part (b): 95% UCB (one-sided)**

      Use :math:`z_{\alpha} = z_{0.05} = 1.645`

      **Part (c): 95% LCB (one-sided)**

      Use :math:`z_{\alpha} = z_{0.05} = 1.645`

      **Part (d): 99% CI (two-sided)**

      Use :math:`z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.005} = 2.576`

      **Part (e): 90% UCB (one-sided)**

      Use :math:`z_{\alpha} = z_{0.10} = 1.282`

      **Part (f): Why 95% UCB critical value is smaller**

      For a two-sided 95% CI, we split the 5% error between both tails (2.5% each), requiring :math:`z_{0.025} = 1.96`.

      For a one-sided 95% UCB, the entire 5% error is in one tail, requiring only :math:`z_{0.05} = 1.645`.

      This makes the bound tighter (closer to :math:`\bar{x}`) on the side of interest.

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         qnorm(0.025, lower.tail = FALSE)  # 1.960 for 95% CI
         qnorm(0.05, lower.tail = FALSE)   # 1.645 for 95% bound
         qnorm(0.005, lower.tail = FALSE)  # 2.576 for 99% CI
         qnorm(0.10, lower.tail = FALSE)   # 1.282 for 90% bound

.. admonition:: Exercise 3: Constructing a UCB
   :class: note

   An EPA inspector tests water quality at a treatment plant. Based on :math:`n = 40` samples, the mean lead concentration is :math:`\bar{x} = 12.7` ppb. The population standard deviation is :math:`\sigma = 4.5` ppb from historical records.

   a. Construct a 95% upper confidence bound for the mean lead concentration.

   b. The EPA safety threshold is 15 ppb. Based on your UCB, is there evidence that the water meets safety standards?

   c. Construct a 99% UCB. Does the conclusion change?

   d. Write a complete interpretation of your 95% UCB in context.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Given: :math:`n = 40`, :math:`\bar{x} = 12.7` ppb, :math:`\sigma = 4.5` ppb

      :math:`SE = \frac{4.5}{\sqrt{40}} = 0.711` ppb

      **Part (a): 95% UCB**

      :math:`z_{0.05} = 1.645`

      .. math::
         UCB = 12.7 + 1.645 \times 0.711 = 12.7 + 1.17 = 13.87 \text{ ppb}

      **Part (b): Compliance check**

      UCB (13.87 ppb) < 15 ppb threshold. Yes, there is evidence the water meets safety standards at 95% confidence.

      **Part (c): 99% UCB**

      :math:`z_{0.01} = 2.326`

      .. math::
         UCB = 12.7 + 2.326 \times 0.711 = 12.7 + 1.65 = 14.35 \text{ ppb}

      UCB (14.35 ppb) < 15 ppb. Conclusion doesn't change—water still meets standards.

      **Part (d): Interpretation**

      We are 95% confident that the true mean lead concentration in water from this treatment plant is at most 13.87 ppb. Since this upper bound is below the EPA safety threshold of 15 ppb, we have statistical evidence that the water meets safety requirements.

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         xbar <- 12.7; sigma <- 4.5; n <- 40
         SE <- sigma / sqrt(n)  # 0.711
         
         # 95% UCB
         xbar + qnorm(0.05, lower.tail = FALSE) * SE  # 13.87
         
         # 99% UCB
         xbar + qnorm(0.01, lower.tail = FALSE) * SE  # 14.35

.. admonition:: Exercise 4: Constructing an LCB
   :class: note

   A battery manufacturer claims their batteries have a mean lifetime of at least 480 hours. Quality control tests :math:`n = 36` batteries, finding :math:`\bar{x} = 492` hours. Historical data shows :math:`\sigma = 30` hours.

   a. Construct a 95% lower confidence bound for mean battery life.

   b. Does the LCB support the manufacturer's claim of at least 480 hours?

   c. Construct a 99% LCB. Does the conclusion change?

   d. What sample size would be needed for the 95% LCB to be exactly 480 hours (given the same :math:`\bar{x}`)?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Given: :math:`n = 36`, :math:`\bar{x} = 492` hours, :math:`\sigma = 30` hours

      :math:`SE = \frac{30}{\sqrt{36}} = 5` hours

      **Part (a): 95% LCB**

      :math:`z_{0.05} = 1.645`

      .. math::
         LCB = 492 - 1.645 \times 5 = 492 - 8.23 = 483.77 \text{ hours}

      **Part (b): Claim evaluation**

      LCB (483.77 hours) > 480 hours. Yes, the LCB supports the manufacturer's claim at 95% confidence.

      **Part (c): 99% LCB**

      :math:`z_{0.01} = 2.326`

      .. math::
         LCB = 492 - 2.326 \times 5 = 492 - 11.63 = 480.37 \text{ hours}

      LCB (480.37 hours) > 480 hours. Claim is still supported, but just barely.

      **Part (d): Required n for LCB = 480**

      .. math::
         480 = 492 - 1.645 \times \frac{30}{\sqrt{n}}

      .. math::
         1.645 \times \frac{30}{\sqrt{n}} = 12

      .. math::
         \sqrt{n} = \frac{1.645 \times 30}{12} = 4.11

      .. math::
         n = 16.9 \Rightarrow n = 17

      **Caution**: This calculation treats :math:`\bar{x} = 492` as fixed. In practice, :math:`\bar{x}` is a random quantity that varies with each sample. For planning purposes, you would typically plan based on a target difference from the threshold and an assumed value for :math:`\mu`, not a specific observed :math:`\bar{x}`.

.. admonition:: Exercise 5: CI vs Confidence Bounds Comparison
   :class: note

   Using the data from Exercise 4 (:math:`\bar{x} = 492`, :math:`\sigma = 30`, :math:`n = 36`):

   a. Construct a 95% confidence interval.

   b. Compare the lower bound of the CI to the 95% LCB from Exercise 4.

   c. Compare the upper bound of the CI to a 95% UCB.

   d. Which provides a tighter bound on each side: the CI or the one-sided bound? Explain why.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Given: :math:`\bar{x} = 492`, :math:`\sigma = 30`, :math:`n = 36`, :math:`SE = 5`

      **Part (a): 95% CI**

      :math:`z_{0.025} = 1.96`

      .. math::
         CI: 492 \pm 1.96 \times 5 = 492 \pm 9.80 = (482.20, 501.80) \text{ hours}

      **Part (b): Lower bound comparison**

      - CI lower bound: 482.20 hours
      - 95% LCB: 483.77 hours
      
      The LCB is **higher** (tighter) than the CI lower bound.

      **Part (c): Upper bound comparison**

      95% UCB: :math:`492 + 1.645 \times 5 = 500.23` hours

      - CI upper bound: 501.80 hours
      - 95% UCB: 500.23 hours
      
      The UCB is **lower** (tighter) than the CI upper bound.

      **Part (d): Explanation**

      One-sided bounds provide tighter limits on the side of interest because they use :math:`z_{\alpha}` instead of :math:`z_{\alpha/2}`:

      - :math:`z_{0.05} = 1.645 < z_{0.025} = 1.96`

      By "spending" all the error probability on one side, we get a more precise statement about that side. The tradeoff is we lose information about the other side.

.. admonition:: Exercise 6: Environmental Compliance
   :class: note

   A factory's wastewater discharge is tested for chemical concentration. Regulations require the mean concentration to be below 3.5 ppm. From :math:`n = 50` samples, :math:`\bar{x} = 3.2` ppm with :math:`\sigma = 0.6` ppm.

   a. Construct a 95% UCB for the mean concentration.

   b. Does the factory demonstrate compliance with the regulation?

   c. Construct a 99% UCB. Does the conclusion change?

   d. What is the probability of incorrectly concluding compliance if the true mean is exactly 3.5 ppm?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Given: :math:`n = 50`, :math:`\bar{x} = 3.2` ppm, :math:`\sigma = 0.6` ppm, limit = 3.5 ppm

      :math:`SE = \frac{0.6}{\sqrt{50}} = 0.0849` ppm

      **Part (a): 95% UCB**

      .. math::
         UCB = 3.2 + 1.645 \times 0.0849 = 3.2 + 0.140 = 3.34 \text{ ppm}

      **Part (b): Compliance**

      Yes, the 95% UCB (3.34 ppm) is below the 3.5 ppm limit, providing evidence of compliance.

      **Part (c): 99% UCB**

      .. math::
         UCB = 3.2 + 2.326 \times 0.0849 = 3.2 + 0.197 = 3.40 \text{ ppm}

      Still in compliance (3.40 < 3.5 ppm). Conclusion doesn't change.

      **Part (d): Probability of incorrect conclusion**

      If the true mean is exactly 3.5 ppm, the UCB will be below 3.5 ppm whenever :math:`\bar{x} + z_{0.05} \times SE < 3.5`.

      Since :math:`\bar{X} \sim N(3.5, SE^2)`, the probability of :math:`\bar{X} < 3.5 - 0.140 = 3.36`:

      .. math::
         P(\bar{X} < 3.36) = P\left(Z < \frac{3.36 - 3.5}{0.0849}\right) = P(Z < -1.645) = 0.05

      There's a **5% probability** of incorrectly concluding compliance when the true mean exactly equals the limit. This is the Type I error rate.

.. admonition:: Exercise 7: Aerospace Materials
   :class: note

   An aerospace company requires composite materials to have mean tensile strength at least 800 MPa. A sample of :math:`n = 30` specimens yields :math:`\bar{x} = 835` MPa with :math:`\sigma = 55` MPa.

   a. Construct a 95% LCB for mean tensile strength.

   b. Does the material meet the specification?

   c. Construct a 99% LCB. Does the conclusion change?

   d. Write a complete interpretation in context.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Given: :math:`n = 30`, :math:`\bar{x} = 835` MPa, :math:`\sigma = 55` MPa, requirement = 800 MPa

      :math:`SE = \frac{55}{\sqrt{30}} = 10.04` MPa

      **Part (a): 95% LCB**

      .. math::
         LCB = 835 - 1.645 \times 10.04 = 835 - 16.52 = 818.48 \text{ MPa}

      **Part (b): Specification check**

      Yes, the 95% LCB (818.48 MPa) exceeds the minimum requirement (800 MPa), providing evidence that the material meets specifications.

      **Part (c): 99% LCB**

      .. math::
         LCB = 835 - 2.326 \times 10.04 = 835 - 23.35 = 811.65 \text{ MPa}

      Still meets requirement (811.65 > 800 MPa). Conclusion doesn't change.

      **Part (d): Interpretation**

      We are 95% confident that the true mean tensile strength of this composite material exceeds 818.48 MPa. Since this lower bound is above the minimum specification of 800 MPa, we have statistical evidence that the material meets the aerospace company's strength requirements.

.. admonition:: Exercise 8: Temperature Control
   :class: note

   A data center requires server room temperature to be between 70°C and 85°C. From :math:`n = 45` measurements, :math:`\bar{x} = 78.5°C` with :math:`\sigma = 8°C`.

   a. Construct a 95% UCB for mean temperature.

   b. Construct a 95% LCB for mean temperature.

   c. Based on both bounds, does the temperature control meet specifications?

   d. What is the relationship between these two separate 95% bounds and a 95% two-sided CI?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      Given: :math:`n = 45`, :math:`\bar{x} = 78.5°C`, :math:`\sigma = 8°C`

      :math:`SE = \frac{8}{\sqrt{45}} = 1.193°C`

      **Part (a): 95% UCB**

      .. math::
         UCB = 78.5 + 1.645 \times 1.193 = 78.5 + 1.96 = 80.46°C

      **Part (b): 95% LCB**

      .. math::
         LCB = 78.5 - 1.645 \times 1.193 = 78.5 - 1.96 = 76.54°C

      **Part (c): Specification check**

      - UCB (80.46°C) < 85°C ✓ (meets upper limit)
      - LCB (76.54°C) > 70°C ✓ (meets lower limit)

      Yes, both specifications are met.

      **Part (d): Relationship to two-sided CI**

      These are two separate 95% bounds, not a 95% two-sided interval. Each bound independently provides 95% confidence.

      **Important note**: Two separate 95% one-sided bounds together correspond to at least 90% joint confidence (since each bound has 5% error probability), not 95%. If you want a single 95% two-sided interval, compute the usual 95% CI using :math:`z_{0.025} = 1.96`:

      .. math::
         CI: 78.5 \pm 1.96 \times 1.193 = (76.16, 80.84)°C

.. admonition:: Exercise 9: Expressing Bounds as Intervals
   :class: note

   Express each confidence bound as an interval using proper notation.

   a. 95% UCB = 13.87 ppb

   b. 95% LCB = 476.02 hours

   c. 99% UCB = 142.5 mg/dL

   d. 90% LCB = 2850 MPa

   .. dropdown:: Solution

      **Part (a): UCB = 13.87 ppb**

      .. math::
         (-\infty, 13.87] \text{ ppb}

      Or equivalently: :math:`\mu \leq 13.87` ppb with 95% confidence.

      **Part (b): LCB = 476.02 hours**

      .. math::
         [476.02, \infty) \text{ hours}

      Or equivalently: :math:`\mu \geq 476.02` hours with 95% confidence.

      **Part (c): UCB = 142.5 mg/dL**

      .. math::
         (-\infty, 142.5] \text{ mg/dL}

      **Part (d): LCB = 2850 MPa**

.. dropdown:: Answers to Practice Problems
   :class-container: sd-border-success

   **True/False Answers:**

   1. **False** — UCB uses :math:`z_{\alpha}` (one-sided), not :math:`z_{\alpha/2}` (two-sided).

   2. **True** — LCB uses :math:`z_{0.05} = 1.645` while CI uses :math:`z_{0.025} = 1.96`, so LCB is closer to x̄.

   3. **True** — LCB provides confidence that μ ≥ LCB value.

   4. **False** — Two 95% one-sided bounds provide at least 90% joint confidence, not 95%.

   5. **True** — :math:`z_{0.05} = 1.645 < z_{0.025} = 1.96`.

   6. **True** — UCB gives the upper limit of plausible values for μ.

   **Multiple Choice Answers:**

   7. **Ⓑ** — 90% bound means α = 0.10, so use :math:`z_{0.10} = 1.282`.

   8. **Ⓒ** — To show pollution is *below* a threshold, demonstrate that UCB < threshold.

   9. **Ⓐ** — UCB = x̄ + z₀.₀₅(σ/√n) = 50 + 1.645(10/5) = 53.29.

   10. **Ⓒ** — UCB has a tighter upper limit because it uses z₀.₀₅ < z₀.₀₂₅.

   11. **Ⓑ** — To show concentration *exceeds* a value, demonstrate LCB > threshold.

   12. **Ⓑ** — One-sided bounds allocate all α error to one tail.
