Paired Two-Sample Analysis
============================================================================

Researchers often encounter situations where observations are naturally paired in practice.
Such dependence requires a revised statistical framework to ensure valid inference.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   * Formulate a paired two-sample problem as a **single-sample problem of differences**, and recognize
     the structural similarities of the analaysis with the one-sample methods.
   * Be aware of the consequences of incorrectly using paired versus independent two-sample methods.

Characteristics of Paired Observations
------------------------------------------------------

Paired-sample procedures are appropriate when **observations are linked by underlying characteristics** 
that create dependence between measurements. These links can arise through several mechanisms:

- Before-and-after studies where each subject is measured twice, before and after a treatment is applied.
- Pairing subjects based on shared characteristics such as age, gender, and diseases severity.
- Applying different treatments to two pieces from the same source
  (also called the **split-plot design**). Examples include sub-plots of crops, pieces cut from the same fabric,
  and metal from the same alloy. 

Pairing is particularly valuable when the extraneous characteristics that link the observations create **large 
variability that might otherwise obscure the treatment effect**. By focusing only on the within-pair differences,
we eliminate the influence of individual variation from the analysis result.

.. _assumptions:

Notation and Assumptions
-------------------------------

We begin with a review of the notation for paired two-sample analyses, first introduced in Chapter 11.1.4.

Observations from Population A and B are denoted :math:`X_{A1}, X_{A2}, \ldots, X_{An}`
and :math:`X_{B1}, X_{B2}, \ldots, X_{Bn}`, respectively. The observations are ordered so that
:math:`X_{Ai}` is paired with :math:`X_{Bi}` for each :math:`i`.

Define the pair-wise differences as:

.. math::

   D_i = X_{Ai} - X_{Bi} \text{ for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, n.

The validity of paired two-sample procedures rests on the following three fundamental assumptions.
They must be carefully verified before applying the inference methods introduced
in this lessson.

Assumption 1. Independence between pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each pair :math:`(X_{Ai}, X_{Bi})` must be independent of all other pairs :math:`(X_{Aj}, X_{Bj})` for :math:`i \neq j`.

.. admonition:: Distinguish within-pair and between-pair independence
   :class: important

   This assumption pertains solely to the independence of pairs *across* the sample; it does not make any claim about 
   the form or strength of association that may exist *within* individual pairs.

Assumption 2. Simple Random Sample of Pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pairs must constitute a simple random sample from the population of potential pairs. 
Combined with Assumption 1, this ensures that the bivariate random variables
:math:`(X_{A1}, X_{B1}), (X_{A2}, X_{B2}), \cdots, (X_{An}, X_{Bn})` form an *iid* sample
of the population of all possible pairs.

This also implies that the pair-wsie differences :math:`D_1, D_2, \cdots, D_n` are *iid*.

Assumption 3. Normality of Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The differences :math:`D_i` must be normally distributed, or the sample size must be large enough for the 
Central Limit Theorem to ensure that :math:`\bar{D}` is approximately normally distributed. 

Note that this assumption concerns the distribution of differences, not the original observations.

The Population Parameter and Its Point Estimator
-------------------------------------------------------

The Population Mean of Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The novelty of the paired two-sample procedure is that it analyzes the **distribution of individual differences**.
Therefore, the central population parameter is :math:`\mu_D`, the true mean of all possible differences.

In fact, however, the point value of :math:`\mu_D` is equal to :math:`\mu_A - \mu_B`, the central parameter
of the independent two-sample procedure. 

.. math::

   \mu_D = E[D_i] = E[X_{Ai} - X_{Bi}] = E[X_{Ai}] - E[X_{Bi}] = \mu_A - \mu_B

This may at first obscure the difference between the two methods, but the key distinction
arises in how the population variance of the differences is defined.

The Population Variacnce of Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the properties of variance for correlated random variables:

.. math::

   \sigma^2_D &= \text{Var}[D_i]\\
              &= \text{Var}[X_{Ai}] + \text{Var}[X_{Bi}] - 2\text{Cov}[X_{Ai}, X_{Bi}]\\
              &= \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B - 2\sigma_A\sigma_B\rho_{AB}

The true variance of the differences now contains an additional term :math:`- 2\sigma_A\sigma_B\rho_{AB}`.

While we could theoretically estimate the components :math:`\sigma^2_A, \sigma^2_B,` and :math:`\rho_{AB},` 
individually, this approach would be unnecessarily complex. 
Instead, the transformation of data from two samples to a single list of differences allows us 
to estimate :math:`\sigma^2_D` directly using :math:`S_D^2`, then 
apply the familiar one-sample :math:`t`-procedures.

The Point Estimator and Its Distribution
-------------------------------------------

Sample Mean of Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample mean of differences provides an ubiased point estimator for :math:`\mu_D`:

.. math::

   \bar{D} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n D_i = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_{Ai} - X_{Bi}) = \bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B

Note that the point value of an observed mean of differences :math:`\bar{d}` is also identical
to the observed difference of the two means :math:`\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B`.

Sampling Distribution of :math:`\bar{D}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the assumptions listed in :numref:`assumptions` above,

.. math::

   \bar{D} \sim N\left(\mu_D, \frac{\sigma_D}{\sqrt{n}}\right).

Sample Variance of Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample variance of differences :math:`S^2_D` is calculated using the standard 
formula applied to the differences:

.. math::

   S^2_D = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (D_i - \bar{D})^2.

This provides an unbiased estimator for :math:`\sigma^2_D`.


Hypothesis Testing for Paired Samples
--------------------------------------------------------------

Paired sample hypothesis testing follows the same four-step framework as one-sample procedures, but with 
careful attention to defining the differences appropriately.

Step 1: Parameter Identification and Difference Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter of interest is :math:`\mu_D`, the mean difference between paired observations. 
Critically, we **must explicitly define how the difference is calculated**, as this determines the 
direction of our alternative hypothesis.

For example, if studying a training program's effectiveness by comparing 
pre-test and post-test scores, we can define the difference :math:`D`
as either:

- :math:`D = X_{\text{pre}} - X_{\text{post}}`, or
- :math:`D = X_{\text{post}} - X_{\text{pre}}`.

The choice should **align with the research question** and the anticipated direction of the effect.

Step 2: Hypothesis Formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The three types of possible hypothesis pairs are:

**Upper-Tailed Hypothesis Test**

.. math::

   &H_0: \mu_D \leq \Delta_0\\
   &H_a: \mu_D > \Delta_0

**Lower-Tailed Hypothesis Test**

.. math::

   &H_0: \mu_D \geq \Delta_0\\
   &H_a: \mu_D < \Delta_0

**Two-Tailed Hypothesis Test**

.. math::

   &H_0: \mu_D = \Delta_0\\
   &H_a: \mu_D \neq \Delta_0

The choice should **reflect how we defined the differences in Step 1**.

Step 3: Test Statistic and P-Value Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test statistic follows the familiar one-sample :math:`t`-test format:

.. math::

   T_{TS} = \frac{\bar{D} - \Delta_0}{S_d/\sqrt{n}}

Under the null hypothesis and the stated assumptions, the test statistic follows a :math:`t`-distribution with 
:math:`df = n - 1`. :math:`p`-value calculation follows the same patterns as one-sample procedures:

.. flat-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 50

   * - :cspan:`2` :math:`p`-Values for paired two-sample :math:`t`-Test

   * - **Upper-tailed**
     - .. math:: 
         P(T_{n-1} \geq t_{TS})
      
       .. code-block:: r
         
         tts <- (dbar-delta0)/(s_d/sqrt(n))
         pt(tts, df=n-1, lower.tail=FALSE)

   * - **Lower-tailed**
     - .. math:: 
          P(T_{n-1} \leq t_{TS})
      
       .. code-block:: r

         pt(tts, df=n-1) 

   * - **Two-tailed**
     - .. math::
          2P(T_{n-1} \leq -|t_{TS}|) \quad \text{ or } \quad 2P(T_{n-1} \geq |t_{TS}|)
      
       .. code-block:: r
          
          2 * pt(-abs(tts), df=n-1)
          2 * pt(abs(tts), df=n-1, lower.tail=FALSE)

Step 4: Decision and Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compare the :math:`p`-value to the predetermined significance level :math:`\alpha` and draw conclusions in the 
context of the original research question, being careful to interpret results in terms of the mean 
difference as defined in Step 1.

.. admonition:: Example 💡: Nursing Sensitivity Training Study
   :class: note

   A regional hospital conducted a study to determine whether sensitivity training would improve the quality 
   of care provided by their nursing staff. Eight nurses were selected, and their nursing skills were evaluated 
   on a scale from 1 to 10, where higher scores indicate greater sensitivity to patients. After this initial 
   assessment, the nurses participated in a training program, and their skills were evaluated again using the 
   same scale.

   Perform a hypothesis test at :math:`\alpha=0.01` to determine if the training improves the quality of 
   care provided by the nursing staff.

   **Step 0: Analysis of Data & Background Information**

   Since each nurse serves as their own control (measured before and after training), this is clearly a paired 
   design. The data shows pre-training scores, post-training scores, and the calculated differences for each nurse:

   .. flat-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 10 20 20 20

      * - 7
        - 7.66
        - 7.33
        - 0.33
      
      * - 8
        - 6.20
        - 6.80
        - 0.60

      * - **Sample mean**
        - :math:`\bar{x}_{pre} = 5.27`
        - :math:`\bar{x}_{post} = 6.57`
        - :math:`\bar{d} = -1.30`
      
      * - **Sample sd**
        - :math:`s_{pre} = 2.018`
        - :math:`s_{post} = 1.803`
        - :math:`s_d = 0.8608`

   **Step 1: Parameter Identification**

   The parameter of interest is :math:`\mu_D`, the true mean difference between pre-training and post-training 
   nursing sensitivity scores. Using the same order as the data table, define the difference as
   :math:`D = X_{\text{pre}} - X_{\text{post}}`.

   **Step 2: Hypothesis Formulation**

   Increase in the score corresponds to a negative value for :math:`\mu_D` as defined in Step 1. Therefore,
   we perform a lower-tailed hypothesis test:

   .. math::
      &H_0: \mu_D \geq 0\\
      &H_a: \mu_D < 0

   **Step 3: Test Statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-Value**

   The observed test statistic is:

   .. math::

      t_{TS} = \frac{\bar{d} - \Delta_0}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{-1.30 - 0}{0.8608/\sqrt{8}} = \frac{-1.30}{0.3044} = -4.2755

   Under the assumptions and the null hypothesis, this value would have been generated from a :math:`t`-distributed
   random variable with :math:`df = n - 1 = 7`.

   For a lower-tailed test, the :math:`p`-value is :math:`p = P(T_7 < -4.2755) = 0.001838`.

   **Step 4: Decision and Conclusion**

   Since p-value :math:`= 0.001838 < \alpha = 0.01`, we reject the null hypothesis.
   The data gives strong support (p-value :math:`= 0.001838`) to the claim that the population average nursing 
   sensitivity score improves after the training.


Confidence Regions for Paired Differences
---------------------------------------------

The :math:`(1-\alpha)100 \%` confidence regions follow the same format as the standard one-sample case:

.. flat-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center
   :widths: 1 2

   * - :cspan:`1` Confidence regions for the mean of differences (paired two-sample procedure)

   * - **Confidence Interval**
     - .. math::

         \bar{d} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}

   * - **Upper Confidence Bound**
     - .. math::

         \bar{d} + t_{\alpha, n-1} \cdot \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}

   * - **Lower Confidence Bound**
     - .. math::

         \bar{d} - t_{\alpha, n-1} \cdot \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}

.. admonition:: Example 💡: Nursing Sensitivity Training Study
   :class: note

   For the study on the sensitivity score of nursing staff before and after training,
   compute the :math:`99\%` confidence region which provides consistent results with the
   previous hypothesis test. Explain how the two inferences agree with each other.

   **The Confidence Region** 

   Since we conducted a left-tailed test, the corresponding confidence bound is an upper bound.
   The critical value is :math:`t_{0.01,7} = 2.998`. Putting the components together,

   .. math::
      UCB = -1.30 + 2.998 \times \frac{0.8608}{\sqrt{8}} = -1.30 + 0.913 = -0.387.

   We are 99% confident that the true mean difference between pre- and post-training scores is 
   less than -0.387. 
   
   **Does It Align with the Hypothesis Test?**

   Since this upper bound is negative (the region does not include the null value
   :math:`\Delta_0= 0`), it confirms that the training program produces improvement.

   **Simultaneous R Implementation of Confidence Region and Hypothesis Testing**

   🛑 This approach works only if you have access to the raw data. 
   If the summary statistics are provided instead, solve the problem by
   substituting appropriate values to an appropriate formula as shown above and in the previous example.

   .. code-block:: r

      # Define the data
      pre_training <- c(2.56, 3.22, 3.45, 5.55, 5.63, 7.89, 7.66, 6.20)
      post_training <- c(4.54, 5.33, 4.32, 7.45, 7.00, 9.80, 7.33, 6.80)
      
      # Perform paired t-test
      t.test(pre_training, post_training,
            mu = 0,
            conf.level = 0.99,
            paired = TRUE,
            alternative = "less")

Importance of Using the Correct Analysis Method
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The choice between paired and independent two-sample procedures depends on the study design 
and data structure. Making the wrong choice can lead to invalid inference or substantial loss of statistical power.

Using Paired Design When Independence Holds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we use a paired design on populations which are in fact independent, we face
two kinds of losses. 

1. **Experimental resources**: We may waste time or 
   expenses trying to find a good pair for each participant and taking measures against
   subject dropouts or carryover effects, when these steps are not necessary.

2. **Reduced degrees of freedom**: When :math:`n=n_A = n_B`, the paired method gives :math:`df=n-1`, while
   the pooled independent two-sample method gives :math:`df=n_A + n_B - 2`. By incorrectly using
   the paired method, we lose half of our "free" datapoints.
   The Welch-Satterthwaite degrees of freedom for unpooled cases are also typically 
   larger than :math:`n-1`. 

The reduced *effective* sample size leads to smaller power. The method does not lose
validity, however, because the paired design covers a general case with no assumptions imposed on
the correlation between the two populations.

Using an Independent Design When Pairing is appropriate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Incorrectly assuming independence when the data should be paired often results in more serious
consequences.

* When the true correlation :math:`\rho_{AB}` is positive,

  .. math::
     \sigma^2_D = \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B - 2\sigma_A\sigma_B\rho_{AB} < \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B.
      
 This means that the independent method **overestimates** the true variance, making the
 inferences less precise (less powerful).

* When the true correlation :math:`\rho_{AB}` is negative,

  .. math::
     \sigma^2_D = \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B - 2\sigma_A\sigma_B\rho_{AB} > \sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B.
 
  In this case, the true variance is **underestimated**, causing the type I error probability to 
  exceed :math:`\alpha`, and the confidence regions to be too narrow to uphold the
  coverage probabiltiy :math:`C`. 

Independent or Paired?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The paired two-sample procedure should be chosen when:

(a) a natural pairing system exists, or
(b) high extraneous variability among subjects requires artificial pairing for
    sufficient power.

When these conditions do not hold, the populations and the sampling procedure should be carefully
examined for any violation of independence. If the indpendence assumption is reasonable, proceed
with an indpendent two-sample analysis.


Bringing It All Together
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **Paired procedures apply when observations are linked** through natural relationships.
      Paired procedures work with differences :math:`D_i = X_{Ai} - X_{Bi}`, 
      which reduces the two-sample problem to a familiar one-sample analysis.

   2. **Three key assumptions** must be satisfied for validity of a paired two-sample inference:
      independence among pairs, simple random sampling from the population of pairs, and normality of differences.

   3. **Pairing controls for individual variability** that might otherwise obscure treatment effects, often 
      leading to more powerful statistical tests.
   
   4. **Proper difference definition is crucial**—the direction of subtraction must align with the research
      question and the alternative hypothesis.
   
   5. **The choice between paired and independent procedures** depends on study design, the presence of natural 
      pairing relationships, and the magnitude of individual variability relative to treatment effects.


Exercises

.. admonition:: Exercise 1: Recognizing Paired Designs
   :class: note

   For each scenario, determine whether a **paired** or **independent** samples analysis is appropriate. Explain the pairing structure if applicable.

   a. Measuring blood pressure of 30 patients before and after taking medication.

   b. Comparing test scores of students taught by Teacher A (n=25) vs. Teacher B (n=28).

   c. Rating the quality of two coffee brands by having 20 tasters rate both brands.

   d. Comparing fuel efficiency by testing 15 cars with Fuel A and 15 different cars with Fuel B.

   e. Testing two keyboard layouts by measuring each of 12 participants' typing speed on both layouts.

   f. Comparing crop yields by planting Variety A on the east half and Variety B on the west half of 18 fields.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): PAIRED ✓**

      Each patient serves as their own control. The "before" and "after" measurements are naturally paired by patient. This controls for individual variation in baseline blood pressure.

      **Pairing structure**: :math:`D_i = \text{BP}_{\text{before},i} - \text{BP}_{\text{after},i}` for patient i.

      **Part (b): INDEPENDENT**

      Different students in each group with no natural pairing. Sample sizes differ (25 vs 28), which is fine for independent samples but impossible for paired.

      **Part (c): PAIRED ✓**

      Each taster rates both brands, creating natural pairs. This controls for differences in individual taste preferences and rating tendencies.

      **Pairing structure**: :math:`D_i = \text{Rating}_{A,i} - \text{Rating}_{B,i}` for taster i.

      **Part (d): INDEPENDENT**

      Different cars receive each fuel—no pairing exists. A paired design would require testing *both* fuels in the *same* cars.

      **Part (e): PAIRED ✓**

      Each participant uses both keyboard layouts. Pairing controls for individual differences in baseline typing ability.

      **Pairing structure**: :math:`D_i = \text{Speed}_{\text{Layout1},i} - \text{Speed}_{\text{Layout2},i}` for participant i.

      **Part (f): PAIRED ✓**

      This is a split-plot design. Each field is divided, with half receiving each variety. Pairing by field controls for soil quality, drainage, and microclimate differences.

      **Pairing structure**: :math:`D_i = \text{Yield}_{A,i} - \text{Yield}_{B,i}` for field i.

      **Part (c): Standard deviation of differences**

      First, calculate :math:`\sum(d_i - \bar{d})^2`:

      .. math::
         &(1.4-1.4375)^2 + (1.3-1.4375)^2 + (1.7-1.4375)^2 + (0.8-1.4375)^2\\

      .. math::
         s_d = \sqrt{\frac{3.6988}{7}} = \sqrt{0.5284} = 0.727

      **Part (d): Verification**

      .. math::
         \bar{x}_{before} = \frac{7.2+6.5+8.1+5.8+7.9+6.2+7.5+6.8}{8} = \frac{56.0}{8} = 7.0

      .. math::
         \bar{x}_{after} = \frac{5.8+5.2+6.4+5.0+5.5+5.9+5.1+5.6}{8} = \frac{44.5}{8} = 5.5625

      .. math::
         \bar{x}_{before} - \bar{x}_{after} = 7.0 - 5.5625 = 1.4375 = \bar{d} \checkmark

.. admonition:: Exercise 3: Defining Differences Correctly
   :class: note

   A fitness instructor measures clients' 5K run times (minutes) before and after a training program.

   a. If the instructor wants to test whether the program **decreases** run times, and defines :math:`D = \text{Time}_{\text{before}} - \text{Time}_{\text{after}}`, write appropriate hypotheses.

   b. If instead :math:`D = \text{Time}_{\text{after}} - \text{Time}_{\text{before}}`, write hypotheses for the same research question.

   c. Given :math:`\bar{d} = 2.5` minutes using definition (a), what would :math:`\bar{d}` be using definition (b)?

   d. Why is it crucial to specify the direction of subtraction in paired analyses?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): D = Before - After**

      If the program decreases run times, then "Before" > "After", so differences are **positive**.

      .. math::
         &H_0: \mu_D \leq 0\\
         &H_a: \mu_D > 0

      (Upper-tailed test)

      **Part (b): D = After - Before**

      If the program decreases run times, then "After" < "Before", so differences are **negative**.

      .. math::
         &H_0: \mu_D \geq 0\\
         &H_a: \mu_D < 0

      (Lower-tailed test)

      **Part (c): Relationship**

      If :math:`\bar{d} = 2.5` using (Before - After), then using (After - Before):

      .. math::
         \bar{d} = -2.5 \text{ minutes}

      The sign flips; the magnitude stays the same.

      **Part (d): Why specification is crucial**

      - The sign of :math:`\bar{d}` and the test statistic depend on the subtraction order
      - The direction of the alternative hypothesis must match the definition
      - Without clear specification, results can be misinterpreted
      - The same conclusion (program works) requires different mathematical statements depending on definition

      **Best practice**: Always state the definition of D in Step 1 of the four-step procedure.

.. admonition:: Exercise 4: Paired t-Test - Upper-Tailed
   :class: note

   A software company tests whether a code optimization improves program execution speed. Ten programs are timed before and after optimization:

   Summary statistics for :math:`D = \text{Time}_{\text{before}} - \text{Time}_{\text{after}}` (seconds):
   
   - :math:`n = 10`
   - :math:`\bar{d} = 0.85`
   - :math:`s_d = 0.42`

   Test whether the optimization reduces execution time at α = 0.05.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Step 1: Define the parameter**

      Let :math:`\mu_D` = true mean difference in execution time (Before - After).

      A positive :math:`\mu_D` means "before" times are larger, indicating improvement (faster after optimization).

      **Step 2: State the hypotheses**

      .. math::
         &H_0: \mu_D \leq 0\\
         &H_a: \mu_D > 0

      **Step 3: Calculate test statistic and p-value**

      Standard error:

      .. math::
         SE = \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.42}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{0.42}{3.162} = 0.133

      Test statistic:

      .. math::
         t_{TS} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{SE} = \frac{0.85}{0.133} = 6.39

      Degrees of freedom: :math:`df = n - 1 = 9`

      P-value (upper-tailed):

      .. math::
         p = P(T_9 > 6.39) < 0.0001

      **Step 4: Decision and Conclusion**

      Since p-value < 0.0001 < α = 0.05, **reject H₀**.

      The data does give strong support (p-value < 0.0001) to the claim that the code optimization reduces execution time. The average improvement is 0.85 seconds.

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         n <- 10; d_bar <- 0.85; s_d <- 0.42
         SE <- s_d / sqrt(n)  # 0.133
         t_ts <- d_bar / SE  # 6.39

      Histogram of paired differences with normal overlay

   a. Why is this a paired design rather than independent samples?

   b. Calculate d̄ and s_D for the differences.

   c. Using the histogram, assess whether the normality assumption for the differences is satisfied.

   d. With n = 12, how important is the normality assumption? When would you be more concerned?

   e. Conduct a paired t-test to determine if the training program improved typing speed at α = 0.05.

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Why paired?**

      This is a paired design because:
      
      - **Same subjects measured twice**: Each participant provides both a "before" and "after" measurement
      - **Natural pairing**: The measurements are linked by individual—participant 1's before is paired with participant 1's after
      - **Correlated measurements**: A person who types fast before training will likely still type relatively fast after
      
      Using independent samples would incorrectly ignore the within-subject correlation and likely have lower power.

      **Part (b): Summary statistics for differences**

      Differences D = After - Before: 7, 6, 5, 9, 4, 9, 5, 7, 5, 7, 6, 8

      .. math::
         \bar{d} = \frac{7+6+5+9+4+9+5+7+5+7+6+8}{12} = \frac{78}{12} = 6.5

      .. math::
         s_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{26}{11}} = 1.537

      **Part (c): Normality assessment from histogram**

      The histogram of differences shows:
      
      - Approximately symmetric distribution
      - Unimodal shape centered around 6-7
      - No extreme outliers
      - Kernel density and normal curve align reasonably well
      
      **Assessment**: The normality assumption for differences appears satisfied ✓

      **Part (d): Importance of normality with n = 12**

      With n = 12, the normality assumption is **moderately important** because:
      
      - Sample size is below the n ≥ 30 guideline for CLT
      - The t-test is fairly robust to mild departures from normality
      - Severe skewness or outliers would be concerning
      
      We would be **more concerned** if:
      
      - The histogram showed strong skewness
      - There were extreme outliers in the differences
      - The QQ-plot showed systematic curvature
      - Sample size were even smaller (e.g., n < 8)

      **Part (e): Paired t-test**

      **Step 1: Define the parameter**

      Let μ_D = true mean difference in typing speed (After - Before).

      **Step 2: State the hypotheses**

      Testing if training improves speed (positive difference):

      .. math::
         H_0: \mu_D \leq 0 \quad \text{vs} \quad H_a: \mu_D > 0

      **Step 3: Check assumptions and calculate test statistic**

      *Assumption checks:*
      
      - **Paired design**: Same subjects measured before and after ✓
      - **Independence of pairs**: Participants are independent of each other ✓
      - **Normality of differences**: Histogram supports approximate normality ✓

      *Test statistic:*

      .. math::
         t_{TS} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_D / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{6.5 - 0}{1.537 / \sqrt{12}} = \frac{6.5}{0.444} = 14.65

      Degrees of freedom: df = n - 1 = 11

      *P-value (upper-tailed):*

      .. math::
         p\text{-value} = P(T_{11} > 14.65) < 0.0001

      **Step 4: Decision and Conclusion**

      Since p-value < 0.0001 < α = 0.05, **reject H<sub>0</sub>**.

      **Conclusion**: At the 0.05 significance level, there is overwhelming evidence that the ergonomic keyboard training program improves typing speed (p < 0.0001). The average improvement of 6.5 words per minute represents a meaningful gain for participants.

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         before <- c(45, 52, 38, 61, 47, 55, 43, 58, 50, 49, 44, 56)

      Differences (A - B): 2, 3, 3, 3, -2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1

      .. math::
         \bar{d} = \frac{2+3+3+3+(-2)+3+3+4+2+3+2+1}{12} = \frac{27}{12} = 2.25

      .. math::

      **Step 3**:

      P-value: :math:`2 \times P(T_{11} > 5.04) = 0.0004`

      **Step 4**: Since p = 0.0004 < 0.05, **reject H₀**.

      The data does give strong support (p-value = 0.0004) to the claim that the mean ratings differ between the two cola brands. Brand A is rated higher on average.

         LCB = 3.2 - 1.761 \times 0.723 = 3.2 - 1.27 = 1.93

      **Part (c): Interpretations**

      **CI**: We are 95% confident that the true mean improvement in production rate is between 1.65 and 4.75 units/hour.

      **LCB**: We are 95% confident that the true mean improvement is at least 1.93 units/hour.

      **Part (d): Can we conclude improvement ≥ 2?**

      The 95% LCB is 1.93 units/hour. Since 1.93 < 2, we **cannot** conclude with 95% confidence that the improvement is at least 2 units/hour.

      However, it's close—a slightly larger sample might push the LCB above 2.

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         n <- 15; d_bar <- 3.2; s_d <- 2.8
         SE <- s_d / sqrt(n)  # 0.723

.. admonition:: Exercise 9: Paired vs. Independent Analysis Comparison
   :class: note

   A researcher incorrectly analyzes paired data as independent samples. Consider:

   - 10 subjects, each measured twice (before/after)
   - Before: :math:`\bar{x}_1 = 50`, :math:`s_1 = 8`
   - After: :math:`\bar{x}_2 = 45`, :math:`s_2 = 9`
   - Differences: :math:`\bar{d} = 5`, :math:`s_d = 3`

   a. Calculate the test statistic and p-value using the **correct** paired analysis.

   b. Calculate the test statistic and p-value using the **incorrect** independent analysis (unpooled).

   c. Compare the results. Why is the paired analysis more powerful here?

   d. Under what conditions would the paired analysis NOT be more powerful?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Correct paired analysis**

      .. math::
         SE_{paired} = \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} = 0.949

      .. math::
         t_{paired} = \frac{5}{0.949} = 5.27

      df = 9

      P-value: :math:`2 \times P(T_9 > 5.27) = 0.0005`

      **Part (b): Incorrect independent analysis**

      .. math::
         \widehat{SE}_{indep} = \sqrt{\frac{8^2}{10} + \frac{9^2}{10}} = \sqrt{6.4 + 8.1} = \sqrt{14.5} = 3.808

      .. math::
         t_{indep} = \frac{5}{3.808} = 1.31

      Welch df ≈ 17.6

      P-value: :math:`2 \times P(T_{17.6} > 1.31) = 0.207`

      **Part (c): Comparison**

      | Analysis | SE | t-statistic | p-value |
      |----------|-----|-------------|---------|
      | Paired | 0.949 | 5.27 | 0.0005 |
      | Independent | 3.808 | 1.31 | 0.207 |

      The paired analysis is dramatically more powerful because:

      1. **Smaller SE**: :math:`s_d = 3` is much smaller than the individual SDs (8 and 9)
      2. This occurs because within-subject variation is controlled
      3. The correlation between before/after is positive (subjects who score high before tend to score high after)
      4. The paired design "removes" this shared variation

      **Part (d): When paired is NOT more powerful**

      Paired analysis may not be more powerful when:

      - **Correlation is zero or negative**: If there's no relationship between paired observations
      - **Degrees of freedom matter more**: Paired has df = n-1 vs. approximately 2n-2 for independent
      - **The pairing is artificial**: Arbitrary pairing of unrelated observations adds no benefit
      - **High carryover effects**: If the first measurement affects the second, this creates bias

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         # Paired
         SE_paired <- 3 / sqrt(10)
         t_paired <- 5 / SE_paired
         2 * pt(t_paired, df = 9, lower.tail = FALSE)  # 0.0005
         
         # Independent
         SE_indep <- sqrt(64/10 + 81/10)
         t_indep <- 5 / SE_indep
         nu <- (6.4 + 8.1)^2 / ((6.4)^2/9 + (8.1)^2/9)  # ≈ 17.6
         2 * pt(t_indep, df = nu, lower.tail = FALSE)  # 0.207

      * - Patient
        - Before

      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Differences and summary statistics**

      Define :math:`D = \text{Before} - \text{After}` (positive = improvement)

      Differences: 2.3, 1.9, 2.1, 0.9, 2.6, 0.7, 2.5, 2.0

      .. math::
         \bar{d} = \frac{2.3+1.9+2.1+0.9+2.6+0.7+2.5+2.0}{8} = \frac{15.0}{8} = 1.875

      .. math::
         s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(d_i - 1.875)^2}{7}} = \sqrt{\frac{3.495}{7}} = \sqrt{0.4993} = 0.707

      **Part (b): Assumptions check**

      1. **Independence between pairs**: ✓ Different patients
      2. **Random sample of pairs**: Assume patients were randomly selected
      3. **Normality of differences**: With n=8, need to verify. All differences are positive and similar in magnitude; no obvious outliers. The small sample is a concern, but data appears reasonably symmetric.

      **Part (c): Hypothesis Test**

      **Step 1**: Let :math:`\mu_D` = true mean reduction in pain score (Before - After).

      **Step 2**:

      .. math::
         &H_0: \mu_D \leq 0\\
         &H_a: \mu_D > 0

      **Step 3**:

      .. math::
         SE = \frac{0.707}{\sqrt{8}} = 0.250

      .. math::
         t_{TS} = \frac{1.875 - 0}{0.250} = 7.50

      df = 7

      P-value: :math:`P(T_7 > 7.50) < 0.0001`

      **Step 4**: Since p < 0.0001 < 0.05, **reject H₀**.

      The data does give strong support (p-value < 0.0001) to the claim that the stretching protocol reduces chronic back pain.

      **Part (d): 95% Confidence Interval**

      :math:`t_{0.025, 7} = 2.365`

      .. math::
         CI: 1.875 \pm 2.365 \times 0.250 = 1.875 \pm 0.591 = (1.28, 2.47)

      **Part (e): Clinical interpretation**

      - **Statistical**: Strong evidence the protocol works (p < 0.0001)
      - **Effect magnitude**: Average pain reduction of 1.875 points on a 0-10 scale
      - **Clinical significance**: A nearly 2-point reduction is typically considered clinically meaningful for pain scales
      - **CI interpretation**: We're 95% confident the true mean reduction is between 1.28 and 2.47 points
      - **All patients improved**: Every patient showed pain reduction, strengthening confidence in the result
      - **Limitations**: Small sample (n=8), no control group, possible placebo effect

      **R verification:**

      .. code-block:: r

         before <- c(7.5, 6.8, 8.2, 5.9, 7.1, 6.5, 8.0, 7.3)
         after <- c(5.2, 4.9, 6.1, 5.0, 4.5, 5.8, 5.5, 5.3)
         
         t.test(before, after, paired = TRUE, alternative = "greater")
         # t = 7.505, df = 7, p < 0.0001
         
         t.test(before, after, paired = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")
         # 95% CI: (1.28, 2.47)

   **True/False Answers:**

   1. **True** — Each observation in Group A is paired with exactly one in Group B.

   2. **False** — Paired t-test has df = n - 1, where n is the number of pairs.

   3. **True** — The mean of differences equals the difference of means.

   4. **True** — By comparing within subjects, individual variation is eliminated.

   5. **True** — We compute differences first, then perform a one-sample t-test on those differences.

   6. **True** — When the same subjects are measured before and after, pairing is natural and appropriate.

   **Multiple Choice Answers:**

   7. **Ⓑ** — Standard error is :math:`s_d/\sqrt{n}`, just like a one-sample t-test.

   8. **Ⓒ** — df = n - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14.

   9. **Ⓑ** — Same students measured twice creates natural pairs.

   10. **Ⓑ** — Positive correlation means within-subject variation is high, which pairing controls for.

   11. **Ⓑ** — :math:`\mu_D = E[D_i] = E[X_{Ai} - X_{Bi}] = \mu_A - \mu_B`.

   12. **Ⓒ** — Independent analysis ignores the pairing structure, leading to larger SE and lower power.
