Data Set Structure and Variable Types
===========================================================================

Imagine being handed a spreadsheet containing thousands of numbers—sales figures, 
temperature readings, or survey responses. Without organization and visualization, 
these numbers remain just that: a collection of digits offering little 
immediate insight.

A raw data file is essentially a *laundry list* of values. This chapter introduces you to the basic vocabulary of structured data sets and demonstrates 
how tables, pie charts, bar graphs, and histograms transform data values into intuitve patterns.
We begin by establishing a common language for organizing and describing a data set. 

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   * Define **case** and **variable**, and understand how they are organized in a rectangular data set.
   * Define **categorical (qualitative)** and **numerical (quantitative)** variables and learn their
     further divisions.
   * Understand that each variable type requires a **different set of summarizing tools** to reflect
     its unique structure.

Understanding the Structure of a Data Set

   Cases and variables in a rectangular spreadsheet

Before delving into visualization techniques, we need to understand how data is organized. 
A **data set** is typically arranged as a rectangular array where 

- *rows* represent **cases**  or **observations** (individual entities such as people, cities, or products), and
- *columns* represent **variables** (specific attributes of each case).

When examining any data set, always begin by asking the three fundamental questions:

* **Who?** - What cases does the data describe? How many cases are there?
* **What?** - Which variables are being measured, with what units, and on what scale? How many variables are there?
* **Why?** - What question motivated the data, and are the variables appropriate for answering that question?

These questions may seem simple, but they provide essential context for any statistical analysis. 
Without understanding their answers, we risk misinterpreting results or drawing 
inappropriate conclusions.

Variable Classification
-------------------------------------------------------

Variables come in different types, each with its own properties and appropriate summarizing methods. 
:numref:`flowchart` illustrates the primary classification system:

   Variable types flow chart

Categorical (Qualitative) Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A categorical variable describes an attribute which can be classified into distinct categories. 
Typically, these categories are distinguished by names or labels and cannot be measured on a numerical scale. 
It can be further divided into:

   * **Nominal variables**: categories with no inherent order (e.g., fruit types, car brands, hair colors)
   * **Ordinal variables**: categories with a meaningful order but uneven or unmeasurable spacing between values 
     (e.g., education levels, survey responses on a scale from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree")

Numerical (Quantitative) Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A numerical variable records measurements or counts that can be expressed on a numerical scale.
It can be subdivided into:

   * **Discrete variables**: variables whose possible outcomes are separate, distinct points 
     with no possible values between consecutive units 
     (e.g., number of books on a shelf, number of students in a classroom)
   * **Continuous variables**: variables that can take any value within a range, limited only by measurement 
     precision (e.g., height, weight, temperature, time)

   .. admonition:: A Tip 🔎: When confused bewteen discrete and continuous...🤔
      :class: error

      Take any single value from the numerical variable. Then ask, 
      **can I clearly identify the "next" (or "previous") point?**
      
      - If yes, then **discrete**
      - If no, then **continuous**

      For example:

      - If there are three students in a classroom now, what is the "next" possible value
        for the student count? Without question, it's four. → **discrete**
      - If the current temperature is 81 degrees Fahrenheit, what is the "next" value it can be?
        82? 81.1? 81.00001? Not clear. → **continuous**


A quantitavie variable can also be classifed as measured on an interval scale or a ratio scale:

.. flat-table::
  :width: 100%

  :widths: 1 3 3

  * - :cspan:`2` Comparison of quantitative variables on interval vs ratio scale

  * - Property
    - Interval scale
    - Ratio scale

  * - True zero
    - Has no true zero point. Its "zero" value does not
      imply the **absence** of the quanity being measured
    - Has meaningful zero that represents the absence of the quantity

  * - Ratios
    - Ratios of values do not have a meaning. 
    - Ratios of values make sense. 

  * - Examples
    - * Celsius temperature: 0 degrees Celcius does not imply any absence.
      * SAT score: If two students received 800 and 1600
        on SAT, it does not mean that the second student did twice as well.
    - * height, weight, time, etc.
      * If two animal species have average heights of
        1 foot and 2 feet, respectively, then it means that the second species is
        twice as tall as the first, on average.

.. admonition:: Example 💡: Variable Type Depends on Both Nature and Context

   When classifying a variable, its definition given by the data collector is just as important as its
   naturally occurring properties. Take the **final exam grades** of an imaginary course, MATH 1234, for example.

   - Researcher 1 records the data as percentage scores after a curve has been applied (Variable 1).
   - Researcher 2 records the data as belonging to one of the intervals 0%-60%, 60%-70%, 70%-80%, then 80%-100%
     (Variable 2).

   Although both variables come from the same source, they are now of distinct types:

   - **Variable 1** is a **continuous numerical variable** on an **interval scale**. A grade of 0% has lost
     its meaning due to the curve. Also, a student with 80% did not perform twice as better as one with 40%.
   - **Variable 2** is an **ordinal categorical variable**. Although a natural order exists among the intervals,
     no meaningful arithmetic oprations are possible between them, indicating that they
     are **not** numerical values.

   In general cases where no experimental details are given, you may focus on the variable's natural
   properties. However, when additional context is available, it must be factored into how you classify it.

Bringing It All Together
--------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. Always identify the *who*, *what* and *why* in a dataset.
   2. Be able to classify a variable by considering both its natural properties and
      its specific usage in an experiment.

.. admonition:: Exercise 1: The Three Fundamental Questions
   :class: note

   Before analyzing any data set, statisticians ask three fundamental questions: **Who?** (What are the cases?), **What?** (What variables are measured?), and **Why?** (What question motivated the data collection?). This exercise practices identifying these elements.

   .. admonition:: Background: Cases and Variables
      :class: tip

      A **data set** is typically organized as a rectangular array where:
      
      - **Rows** represent **cases** (also called observations)—the individual entities being studied
      - **Columns** represent **variables**—the specific attributes measured for each case
      
      Clearly identifying cases is crucial because it determines the unit of analysis and affects which statistical methods are appropriate.

   **Scenario A — Software Performance Testing**

   A quality assurance team at a software company records data on 150 automated test runs. For each test run, they record: the test ID, the module being tested (Authentication, Database, UI, or API), execution time in milliseconds, memory usage in MB, pass/fail status, and the build version number.

   a. **Who?** Identify the cases in this data set. How many cases are there?

   b. **What?** List all variables being measured. For each, identify the units (if applicable).

   c. **Why?** What research questions might have motivated collecting this data?

   **Scenario B — Manufacturing Quality Control**

   An aerospace components manufacturer inspects turbine blades. Each blade is assigned a serial number, measured for length (mm), weight (grams), inspected for surface defects (None, Minor, Major), tested for tensile strength (MPa), and assigned a quality grade (A, B, C, or Reject).

   d. **Who?** Identify the cases. What uniquely identifies each case?

   e. **What?** List all variables. Which might be considered an identifier rather than a true variable?

   f. **Why?** Propose two different research questions that could be addressed with this data.

   **Scenario C — Network Security Analysis**

   A cybersecurity team monitors network traffic, recording data on 10,000 connection attempts. For each attempt, they log: timestamp, source IP address, destination port number, packet size (bytes), protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and whether the connection was flagged as suspicious (Yes/No).

   g. **Who?** What constitutes a single case in this study?

   h. **What?** Identify all variables. Which variable might serve as a response variable in a classification model?

   i. **Why?** How might the research question differ between a real-time intrusion detection system and a post-incident forensic analysis?

      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Part (a): Software Testing — Cases**

      The **cases** are the individual **test runs**. There are **150 cases** in the data set.

      Note: The cases are NOT the modules, even though modules are recorded. Each row represents one test run, and the same module can appear in multiple rows.

      **Part (b): Software Testing — Variables**

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 30 20

         * - Variable
           - Description
           - Units
         * - Test ID
           - Unique identifier for each test
           - (identifier, no units)
         * - Module
           - Component being tested
           - (categories: Auth, DB, UI, API)
         * - Execution time
           - How long the test took
           - milliseconds (ms)
         * - Memory usage
           - RAM consumed during test
           - megabytes (MB)
         * - Pass/fail status
           - Test outcome
           - (categories: Pass, Fail)
         * - Build version
           - Software version tested
           - (version number)

      **Part (c): Software Testing — Research Questions**

      Possible research questions include:

      - Do certain modules consistently take longer to test or use more memory?
      - Is there a relationship between execution time and memory usage?
      - Do newer build versions have higher pass rates?
      - Which modules have the highest failure rates?

      **Part (d): Manufacturing — Cases**

      The **cases** are the individual **turbine blades**. Each blade is uniquely identified by its **serial number**.

      **Part (e): Manufacturing — Variables**

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 40

         * - Variable
           - Notes
         * - Serial number
           - **Identifier** (not a true variable for analysis)
         * - Length
           - Measurement variable (mm)
         * - Weight
           - Measurement variable (grams)
         * - Surface defects
           - Categorical variable (None/Minor/Major)
         * - Tensile strength
           - Measurement variable (MPa)
         * - Quality grade
           - Categorical variable (A/B/C/Reject)

      The **serial number** is an identifier, not a variable of interest. It uniquely labels each case but carries no analytical meaning—we wouldn't compute an "average serial number."

      **Part (f): Manufacturing — Research Questions**

      1. **Predictive question**: Can we predict quality grade from the physical measurements (length, weight, tensile strength)?
      
      2. **Quality control question**: What proportion of blades have surface defects, and is there a relationship between defect severity and tensile strength?

      **Part (g): Network Security — Cases**

      The **cases** are the individual **connection attempts**. Each of the 10,000 connection attempts represents one case.

      **Part (h): Network Security — Variables**

      The variables are: timestamp, source IP, destination port, packet size, protocol type, and suspicious flag.

      The **suspicious flag (Yes/No)** would likely serve as the **response variable** in a classification model, with the other variables serving as predictors.

      **Part (i): Network Security — Research Questions**

      - **Real-time detection**: The question is *predictive*—"Given the characteristics of an incoming connection, should we flag it as suspicious?" Speed and false-positive rates are critical.
      
      - **Forensic analysis**: The question is *descriptive/explanatory*—"What patterns characterize the suspicious connections? Which IP addresses or ports were most commonly involved?" Thoroughness matters more than speed.

.. admonition:: Exercise 2: Categorical vs. Numerical Classification
   :class: note

   The first major distinction in variable classification is between **categorical (qualitative)** and **numerical (quantitative)** variables. This exercise develops your ability to make this fundamental distinction, including tricky cases where numbers don't necessarily mean numerical.

   .. admonition:: Key Principle
      :class: important

      **Numbers don't automatically make a variable numerical.** A variable is numerical only if arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, averaging) produce meaningful results. ZIP codes, jersey numbers, and ID numbers contain digits but are categorical—averaging them makes no sense.

   For each variable below, classify it as **categorical** or **numerical**. Provide a brief justification focusing on whether arithmetic operations are meaningful.

   a. The response time (in milliseconds) of a web server handling API requests.

   b. The HTTP status code returned by a server (200, 404, 500, etc.).

   c. The processor architecture of computers in a data center (x86, ARM, RISC-V).

   d. The number of CPU cores in a server.

   e. The MAC address of a network interface card.

   f. The star rating (1-5 stars) given in app store reviews.

   g. The temperature of a CPU under load, measured in degrees Celsius.

   h. The version number of a software release (e.g., 2.4.1).

   i. The employee ID number at a tech company.

   j. The bandwidth of a network connection in Mbps.

   k. The priority level of support tickets (Low, Medium, High, Critical).

   l. The number of bugs found in a code review.

         * - Part
           - Classification
           - Justification
         * - (a)
           - **Numerical**
           - Response time is a **measurement of duration**. Averaging response times (e.g., "mean response time was 45 ms") is meaningful. Even if recorded as whole milliseconds, time is fundamentally continuous.
         * - (b)
           - **Categorical**
           - HTTP status codes are labels for categories of responses. The "average" of 200 and 404 (= 302) has no meaning. Code 302 exists but isn't the "average" of success and not-found.
         * - (c)
           - **Categorical**
           - Architecture names are labels with no numerical interpretation.
         * - (d)
           - **Numerical**
           - This is a **count** of physical components. "One server has twice as many cores as another" is a meaningful statement.
         * - (e)
           - **Categorical**
           - MAC addresses are identifiers. Despite being hexadecimal numbers, arithmetic operations are meaningless.
         * - (f)
           - **Categorical** (ordinal)
           - While stars use numbers 1-5, the intervals between ratings may not be equal. Is the difference between 1 and 2 stars the same as between 4 and 5 stars? Typically treated as ordinal categorical. (Note: Some analysts treat such ratings as numerical for convenience, but strictly speaking, they are ordinal.)
         * - (g)
           - **Numerical**
           - Temperature is a **physical measurement**. Differences are meaningful ("10°C warmer"). Even if displayed as whole degrees, temperature could theoretically be 72.347°C.
         * - (h)
           - **Categorical**
           - Version numbers are labels. Version 2.0 is not "twice" version 1.0, and 2.4.1 cannot be meaningfully averaged with 3.1.0.
         * - (i)
           - **Categorical**
           - Employee IDs are identifiers, not quantities. The "average employee ID" is meaningless.
         * - (j)
           - **Numerical**
           - Bandwidth is a **measurement of data transfer rate**. "100 Mbps is twice as fast as 50 Mbps" is meaningful. As a rate, it's fundamentally continuous.
         * - (k)
           - **Categorical**
           - Priority levels are ordered categories (labels), not measurements.
         * - (l)
           - **Numerical**
           - This is a **count** of discrete events. "We found twice as many bugs this sprint" is meaningful.

      **Key Insight**: The presence of numbers does not make a variable numerical. Ask yourself: "Does it make sense to compute an average of these values?" If the answer is no, the variable is categorical.

      **Preview of Discrete vs. Continuous**: Notice that some numerical variables above are **counts** (cores, bugs) while others are **measurements** (response time, temperature, bandwidth). This distinction becomes important in Exercise 3: counts are discrete, measurements are continuous.

----

.. admonition:: Exercise 3: Sub-classification — Nominal/Ordinal and Discrete/Continuous
   :class: note

   Once you've identified whether a variable is categorical or numerical, the next step is sub-classification:
   
   - **Categorical variables** are either **nominal** (no natural ordering) or **ordinal** (meaningful order exists)
   - **Numerical variables** are either **discrete** (countable, distinct values) or **continuous** (any value in a range)

   .. admonition:: The "Next Value" Test for Discrete vs. Continuous
      :class: tip

      For numerical variables, ask: **"Can I clearly identify the next possible value?"**
      
      - If **yes** → **discrete** (e.g., number of students: 3 → next is 4)
      - If **no** → **continuous** (e.g., temperature: 81°F → next could be 81.1, 81.01, 81.001...)

      **Apply this test to the theoretical scale, not the recorded precision:**
      
      - After 81.0 bpm, what is the "next possible" heart rate? Is it 82? No—81.01 bpm is possible. Is it 81.01? No—81.001 is possible. The next value is **not well-defined** because infinitely many values exist between any two points → **continuous**
      
      - After 3 defects, what is the "next possible" count? It's 4. There is no value between 3 and 4 defects → **discrete**

   .. admonition:: Classify by Potential, Not Recording Precision
      :class: warning

      **Important**: We classify variables based on what they *could theoretically be*, not how they happen to be recorded. 
      
      - Heart rate is **continuous** because it's a rate that could take any positive value (72.3 bpm), even though monitors often display integers
      - Time is **continuous** even if your stopwatch only shows whole seconds
      - Weight is **continuous** even if the scale rounds to the nearest pound
      
      Ask: "If I had a perfect measuring instrument with unlimited precision, could this take non-integer values?" If yes → continuous.

   For each variable, provide the complete classification: (Categorical Nominal, Categorical Ordinal, Numerical Discrete, or Numerical Continuous).

   **Part A: Software Engineering Context**

   a. The programming language used in a project (Python, Java, C++, Rust).

   b. The number of commits to a repository in a day.

      .. admonition:: Note on Pain Scales and Likert-Type Items
         :class: warning

         Variables like pain scales (0-10) and star ratings (1-5) are technically **ordinal** because we cannot assume equal intervals between points. However, in practice, researchers sometimes treat them as numerical for convenience when computing means. This is a simplification that should be noted and justified. In STAT 350, we will generally classify such rating scales as **categorical ordinal** unless stated otherwise.

      .. admonition:: The "Could It Be Non-Integer?" Principle
         :class: tip

         A helpful rule for distinguishing discrete from continuous:
         
         - **Counts** (number of events, items, cycles, doses) → always **discrete**
         - **Measurements** (length, weight, time, concentration, rates) → always **continuous**
         
         **Apply the "next value" test to the theoretical scale:**
         
         - Heart rate displayed as "72 bpm": After 72.0 bpm, is the next possible value 73? No—72.1 is possible. Is it 72.1? No—72.01 is possible. The next value is **undefined** → **continuous**
         
         - Dose count shown as "3 doses": After 3 doses, is the next possible value 4? **Yes**—you cannot administer 3.5 doses. The next value is **well-defined** → **discrete**

.. admonition:: Exercise 4: Interval vs. Ratio Scales
   :class: note

   For numerical variables, an additional distinction exists between **interval** and **ratio** scales:

   - **Ratio scale**: Has a meaningful zero (zero = absence of the quantity) and meaningful ratios ("twice as much" makes sense)
   - **Interval scale**: Has arbitrary zero point; only differences are meaningful, not ratios

   .. admonition:: Key Questions for Interval vs. Ratio
      :class: tip

      Ask two questions:
      
      1. **Does zero mean "none" or "absence"?** If yes → ratio scale
      2. **Does "twice as much" make sense?** If yes → ratio scale
      
      If either answer is no, it's likely an interval scale.

   For each numerical variable below, classify it as **interval** or **ratio** scale. Justify your answer by addressing whether zero represents absence and whether ratios are meaningful.

   a. The temperature of a server room in degrees Fahrenheit.

   b. The temperature of a server room in Kelvin.

   c. The amount of RAM in a computer (in GB).

   d. A student's score on a standardized test (SAT: 400-1600).

   e. The time taken to complete a task (in seconds).

   f. The year a software product was released (e.g., 2023).

   g. The mass of a rocket's payload (in kg).

   h. The IQ score of research participants.

   i. The altitude of a drone above sea level (in meters).

   j. The voltage across a circuit component (in volts).

         * - (b)
           - **Ratio**

           - **Interval**
           - A score of 0 (if it existed) wouldn't mean "no knowledge." A score of 1200 doesn't mean someone knows "twice as much" as someone with 600. The scale measures relative performance, not absolute ability.
         * - (e)
           - **Ratio**

           - **Interval** (surprisingly!)
           - Altitude is measured relative to sea level, which is an arbitrary reference. Negative values are possible (below sea level). Zero doesn't mean "no altitude." *However*, if measuring height above ground level for a specific application, it could be ratio.
         * - (j)
           - **Interval**
           - Voltage is measured relative to a reference point (ground). A potential of 0V means equal to the reference, not "absence of voltage." Negative voltages exist.

      .. admonition:: Important Insight
         :class: important

         **Context can determine the scale.** Altitude above sea level is interval (arbitrary reference), but "height of a building" would be ratio (0 = no height). Similarly, Celsius temperature is interval, but Kelvin is ratio. Always consider what zero represents in the specific context.

.. admonition:: Exercise 5: Context-Dependent Classification
   :class: note

   A crucial insight from Chapter 2.1 is that **context determines classification**. The same underlying measurement can become different variable types depending on how it's recorded and used.

   .. admonition:: The Final Exam Example
      :class: tip

      From the textbook: Final exam grades can be:
      
      - **Continuous numerical** if recorded as percentage scores (0-100)
      - **Categorical ordinal** if recorded as grade intervals (0-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-100%)
      
      The underlying reality is the same; the variable type depends on the researcher's choice of how to record the data.

   For each scenario, the same type of information is recorded differently by two researchers. Classify the variable type for each researcher's version.

   **Scenario A: Algorithm Performance**

   A computer scientist measures algorithm execution time:
   
   - **Researcher 1** records the exact execution time in milliseconds (e.g., 142.7 ms)
   - **Researcher 2** records whether the time was "Fast" (< 100 ms), "Medium" (100-500 ms), or "Slow" (> 500 ms)

   a. Classify Researcher 1's variable.
   b. Classify Researcher 2's variable.
   c. What information is lost by Researcher 2's approach? When might it still be useful?

   **Scenario B: Customer Satisfaction**

   A product team collects feedback on a new app feature:
   
   - **Researcher 1** records the number of times each user accessed the feature in one week (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
   - **Researcher 2** records usage as "Non-user" (0 times), "Light user" (1-3 times), or "Heavy user" (4+ times)

   d. Classify Researcher 1's variable.
   e. Classify Researcher 2's variable.
   f. For what type of analysis might each approach be preferred?

   **Scenario C: Manufacturing Precision**

   A quality engineer inspects the diameter of precision bearings:
   
   - **Researcher 1** records the exact diameter in mm to four decimal places
   - **Researcher 2** records whether each bearing is "Within tolerance" or "Out of tolerance"
   - **Researcher 3** records the deviation from nominal as "Under" (-), "Nominal" (0), or "Over" (+)

   g. Classify Researcher 1's variable.
   h. Classify Researcher 2's variable.
   i. Classify Researcher 3's variable.
   j. Which researcher's approach would be best for process control charting? For simple pass/fail reporting?

   **Scenario D: Server Health Monitoring**

   A DevOps team monitors server CPU temperature:
   
   - **Researcher 1** records temperature in Kelvin
   - **Researcher 2** records temperature in Celsius
   - **Researcher 3** records as "Cool" (< 40°C), "Normal" (40-70°C), "Warm" (70-85°C), or "Hot" (> 85°C)

   k. Classify Researcher 1's variable and its measurement scale.
   l. Classify Researcher 2's variable and its measurement scale.
   m. Classify Researcher 3's variable.
   n. Can Researcher 2's data be converted to Researcher 1's format? Can Researcher 3's?

   .. dropdown:: Solution
      :class-container: sd-border-success

      **Scenario A: Algorithm Performance**

      a. **Researcher 1**: Numerical continuous, ratio scale (0 ms = no time, ratios meaningful)
      
      b. **Researcher 2**: Categorical ordinal (ordered categories: Fast < Medium < Slow)
      
      c. **Information lost**: The exact magnitude of differences. Was a "Fast" run 50 ms or 99 ms? Were two "Slow" runs equally slow?
      
         **When categorical is useful**: For quick summaries, dashboard displays, or when exact times aren't actionable (e.g., any "Fast" result is acceptable).

      **Scenario B: Customer Satisfaction**

      d. **Researcher 1**: Numerical discrete (counts: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
      
      e. **Researcher 2**: Categorical ordinal (ordered categories: Non-user < Light user < Heavy user)
      
      f. **Analysis preferences**:
      
         - **Researcher 1's approach**: Better for computing exact statistics (mean usage, correlations with other metrics) and building predictive models
         - **Researcher 2's approach**: Better for segmentation analysis, creating user personas, or simple reporting to stakeholders

      **Scenario C: Manufacturing Precision**

      g. **Researcher 1**: Numerical continuous, ratio scale
      
      h. **Researcher 2**: Categorical nominal (only two categories with no inherent order—though one could argue it's ordinal if "Within tolerance" is considered "better")
      
      i. **Researcher 3**: Categorical ordinal (Under < Nominal < Over represents a meaningful order)
      
      j. **Best approach by purpose**:
      
         - **Process control charting**: Researcher 1 (need exact values to plot on control charts, detect trends)
         - **Pass/fail reporting**: Researcher 2 (simplest for compliance reporting)

      **Scenario D: Server Health Monitoring**

      k. **Researcher 1**: Numerical continuous, **ratio scale** (0 K = absolute zero, ratios meaningful)
      
      l. **Researcher 2**: Numerical continuous, **interval scale** (0°C is arbitrary—water freezing point, not absence of temperature)
      
      m. **Researcher 3**: Categorical ordinal (Cool < Normal < Warm < Hot)
      
      n. **Convertibility**:
      
         - **Researcher 2 → Researcher 1**: Yes, using formula K = °C + 273.15. No information is lost.
         - **Researcher 3 → Researcher 1 or 2**: No! We cannot recover exact temperatures from categories. A "Normal" reading could have been anywhere from 40°C to 70°C.

      .. admonition:: Key Insight: Information Hierarchy
         :class: important

         There's a hierarchy of information richness:
         
         **Numerical (continuous/discrete) → Ordinal → Nominal**
         
         You can always convert "down" (continuous → ordinal → nominal) but **never up**. Once information is binned into categories, the original precision is lost forever. This is why the choice of how to record data should be made carefully at the design stage.

.. admonition:: Exercise 6: Comprehensive Data Set Analysis
   :class: note

   This exercise applies all concepts to a realistic engineering data set. You'll practice identifying cases, variables, and complete classifications.

   **Scenario: Electric Vehicle Battery Testing**

   A research lab is testing batteries for electric vehicles. The data set contains records from 200 test cycles. For each test cycle, the following information is recorded:

        - Description
      * - ``TestID``
        - Unique identifier for each test (T001, T002, ...)
      * - ``BatteryModel``
        - Battery model (Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
      * - ``CellChemistry``
        - Chemistry type (NMC, LFP, NCA, Solid-State)
      * - ``CycleNumber``
        - Which charge-discharge cycle this test represents (1, 2, 3, ...)
      * - ``Temperature``
        - Ambient temperature during test (°C)
      * - ``ChargeRate``
        - Charging rate category (Standard, Fast, Ultrafast)
      * - ``ChargingTime``
        - Time to full charge (minutes)
      * - ``Capacity``
        - Measured capacity (kWh)
      * - ``Efficiency``
        - Round-trip efficiency (%)
      * - ``DegradationLevel``
        - Observed degradation (None, Mild, Moderate, Severe)
      * - ``CellCount``
        - Number of cells in the battery pack
      * - ``PassFail``
        - Whether the battery passed quality standards (Pass, Fail)

   Answer the following questions:

   a. **Who?** What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there?

   b. **What?** List all variables and identify which is an identifier rather than a true analytical variable.

   c. **Why?** Propose three different research questions this data could address.

   d. **Complete Classification**: For each variable (excluding the identifier), provide the full classification using the table format below:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - ...
           - ...
           - ...
           - ...

   e. **Critical Thinking**: The ``Efficiency`` variable is recorded as a percentage. Someone argues it should be interval scale because "100% efficiency is theoretically impossible and represents a ceiling, not true absence." Another person argues it's ratio scale because "0% efficiency means no energy is transferred—true absence of efficiency." Who is correct? Discuss.

   f. **Critical Thinking**: If the research question changed from "What factors affect battery degradation?" to "Are there systematic differences between the three battery models?", would this change how any variables should be classified? Explain.

      **Part (a): Cases**

      The **cases** are the individual **test cycles**. There are **200 cases** in the data set.

      Note: The cases are NOT the batteries themselves. The same battery model can be tested multiple times, and each test cycle is a separate observation.

      **Part (b): Variables**

      All columns are variables, but ``TestID`` is an **identifier** rather than an analytical variable. It serves only to uniquely label each case and wouldn't be included in statistical analysis (we wouldn't compute "mean TestID").

      **Part (c): Research Questions**

      1. **Predictive**: Can we predict DegradationLevel based on CycleNumber, Temperature, and ChargeRate?
      
      2. **Comparative**: Is there a significant difference in Capacity between the three CellChemistry types?
      
      3. **Optimization**: What combination of Temperature and ChargeRate maximizes Efficiency while minimizing ChargingTime?

      **Detailed Reasoning for Each Variable:**

      - **CycleNumber** (Discrete): This is a **count** of charge-discharge cycles. After cycle 2, what's the next possible value? Exactly **3**—you cannot have cycle 2.5. The "next value" is well-defined → **discrete**.
      
      - **Temperature** (Continuous): Temperature is a **physical measurement**. After 25.0°C, what's the next possible value? 26? No—25.1 is possible. 25.1? No—25.01 is possible. The "next value" is undefined → **continuous**.
      
      - **ChargingTime** (Continuous): Time is a **duration measurement**. After 45.0 minutes, the next value could be 45.1, 45.01, 45.001... The "next value" is undefined → **continuous**.
      
      - **Capacity** (Continuous): Energy capacity is a **physical measurement**. A battery labeled as "75 kWh" might actually be 74.847... kWh. After any capacity value, infinitely many values exist before reaching the next integer → **continuous**.
      
      - **Efficiency** (Continuous): Efficiency is a **ratio of measurements** (output energy / input energy × 100). After 87.0% efficiency, the next value could be 87.1%, 87.01%, 87.001%... → **continuous**.
      
      - **CellCount** (Discrete): This is a **count** of physical objects. After 96 cells, what's the next possible value? Exactly **97**—you cannot have 96.5 cells in a pack. The "next value" is well-defined → **discrete**.

      **Part (e): Efficiency Scale Discussion**

      This is a genuinely debatable case, and both arguments have merit:

      **Argument for Ratio Scale** (stronger):
      
      - 0% efficiency means zero output energy per input energy—a true "absence" of energy transfer efficiency
      - "40% efficiency is twice 20% efficiency" is a meaningful statement
      - The scale has a natural, non-arbitrary zero point

      **Argument for Interval Scale**:
      
      - In practice, 0% and 100% may be theoretical limits never achieved
      - The percentage is computed from measurements that may have their own scale issues
      - Some argue percentages derived from ratios have interval-like properties

      **Conclusion**: Most statisticians would classify efficiency as **ratio scale** because zero has a meaningful interpretation (no energy transfer) and ratios are interpretable. The theoretical impossibility of exactly 0% or 100% doesn't change the scale type—height is ratio scale even though 0 height is impossible for a living person.

      **Part (f): Changing Research Questions**

      The **variable classifications themselves don't change** based on the research question—a variable's type is inherent to how it was measured.

      However, the **role** of variables changes:
      
      - For "What affects degradation?": DegradationLevel is the **response variable**; BatteryModel is one of several **explanatory variables**
      - For "Differences between models?": BatteryModel becomes the primary **grouping variable**; various numerical measurements become **response variables** for comparison

      The research question also affects which statistical methods are appropriate:
      
      - Predicting an ordinal response → ordinal regression or classification methods
      - Comparing groups → ANOVA, t-tests, or non-parametric alternatives

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **Always start with Who/What/Why**: Identifying cases, variables, and research questions provides essential context for any analysis.

   2. **Numbers ≠ Numerical**: ZIP codes, ID numbers, HTTP codes, and version numbers contain digits but are categorical. Ask: "Does averaging make sense?"

   3. **Use the "Next Value" test on the theoretical scale**: Ask "Can I identify the next possible value?"
      
      - After 3 defects → next is 4 (well-defined) → **discrete**
      - After 72.0 bpm → next is 72.1? No, 72.01 is possible. 72.01? No, 72.001 is possible (undefined) → **continuous**

   4. **Classify by potential, not precision**: We classify based on what a variable *could theoretically be*, not how it's recorded:
      
      - **Counts** (events, items, cycles) → always **discrete** (next value is well-defined)
      - **Measurements** (length, weight, time, rates) → always **continuous** (next value is undefined)
      - Heart rate displayed as "72 bpm" is still continuous because 72.34 bpm is theoretically possible

   5. **Zero and ratios determine scale**: Ratio scale requires a meaningful zero (absence) and interpretable ratios. Interval scale has only meaningful differences.

   6. **Context determines classification**: The same underlying measurement can become different variable types depending on how it's recorded. Choose carefully—you can always discard precision later, but you can never recover it.

   7. **Classification guides analysis**: The type of variable determines which summary statistics, visualizations, and inferential methods are appropriate. Getting classification right is the foundation for everything that follows.

   **True/False Answers:**

   1. **False** — Cases can be any entity being studied: people, products, test runs, transactions, animals, etc.

   2. **True** — Star ratings are ordered (1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5) but we cannot assume equal intervals between ratings, making them ordinal.

   3. **False** — ZIP codes are categorical (nominal). Arithmetic operations on ZIP codes are meaningless—the "average ZIP code" has no interpretation.

   4. **True** — This is the defining characteristic that distinguishes ratio from interval scales.

   5. **False** — Defect counts are discrete because they are **counts** of discrete events. After 2 defects, the next possible value is exactly 3—you cannot have 2.5 defects. The "next value" is well-defined → discrete. Key rule: **counts are always discrete; measurements are always continuous**.

   6. **True** — Kelvin has a true zero (absolute zero = no thermal energy), while Celsius zero is arbitrary (water freezing point).

   **Multiple Choice Answers:**

   7. **Ⓑ** — IP addresses are identifiers/labels. Despite containing numbers, arithmetic operations are meaningless. You can't compute an "average IP address."

   8. **Ⓓ** — Tensile strength is a **physical measurement** (force per unit area), which is fundamentally continuous. After 450 MPa, what's the next possible value? 451? No—450.1 is possible. 450.1? No—450.01 is possible. The "next value" is undefined → **continuous**.

   9. **Ⓑ** — Interval scales have arbitrary zero points (e.g., Celsius), while ratio scales have zeros representing true absence (e.g., Kelvin, mass).

   10. **Ⓑ** — Rows = cases (50 patients), columns = variables (8 measurements per patient).
