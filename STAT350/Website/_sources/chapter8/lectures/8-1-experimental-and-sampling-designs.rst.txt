Experimental and Sampling Designs
===============================================


We're now standing at a crucial bridge in our statistical journey. We've explored data through descriptive methods, 
built probability models to understand uncertainty, and learned how sample statistics behave through sampling 
distributions and the Central Limit Theorem. These tools have equipped us to understand how information flows 
from populations to samples. But before we can confidently make the reverse journey‚Äîinferring from samples back 
to populations‚Äîwe need one final, essential piece: **understanding how to collect data properly in the first place**.

Statistical inference is powerful, but it's only as reliable as the data it's based on.
This chapter focuses on the critical foundation that makes valid statistical inference possible: thoughtful, 
principled approaches to study design and data collection.

   :class: important

   * Identify the characteristics of a **statistical question**.
   * Understand that data contain **statistical variation** from different sources, and that
     each source is treated differently in an experiment.
   * Recognize the **different sources of data**, along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.
   * Distinguish between **observational and experimental studies**.

Statistical Questions and the Need for Data
---------------------------------------------

Our journey toward statistical inference begins with recognizing what makes a question statistical in nature. 

Statistical vs. Deterministic Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not every question involving data is statistical. If we can predict an outcome with certainty given the inputs‚Äîlike 
calculating the area of a rectangle from its length and width‚Äîwe're dealing with a deterministic relationship. 
**Statistical questions**, by contrast, involve relationships where **perfect prediction is impossible**, 
but where we can still identify meaningful patterns and quantify uncertainty **by analyzing data**.

A data always comes with inherent variability. This variability isn't always a flaw to be eliminated‚Äîit's often the fundamental 
characteristic that makes statistical methods both necessary and powerful.

The Nature of Statistical Variation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Statistical variation arises from multiple sources.

- **Subject differences**: Individual units in our study naturally vary in their characteristics, responses, and behaviors.
- **Measurement errors**: Even the most precise instruments introduce some degree of measurement uncertainty.
- **Random chance**: Inherent randomness in natural processes and human behavior.

Ideally, we want the primary source of variation in our data to be random chance, with other sources minimized 
through careful design. We aim to reduce measurement errors through precise instruments and standardized procedures, 
and we handle subject differences through proper randomization and control strategies.

The Spectrum of Data Sources
----------------------------

Before conducting any study, researchers face a fundamental decision: where will their data come from? This choice shapes everything that follows‚Äîthe types of conclusions that can be drawn, the statistical methods that are appropriate, and the confidence we can place in our results. Understanding the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of different data sources is essential for making informed research decisions.

Anecdotal Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Anecdotal data** represents the most basic form of information‚Äîobservations from personal experiences, casual reports, 
or informal accounts shared through news media and social networks. While **lacking scientific rigor**, anecdotal evidence 
plays a surprisingly important role in the research ecosystem by **providing insights or raising hypotheses** to be studied further.

Available Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modern research landscape is dominated by an unprecedented availability of existing data. 
**Available data** includes any information that has already been collected and can be accessed 
for research purposes, ranging from government statistics and published study datasets to corporate 
databases and social media archives.

However, we do not have control over the quality, accuracy, and completeness of an available data,
which can impact the reliability of the results and insights derived from it. It is important to asseess
the quality of the available data carefully by considering data sources, data collection methods, and
data processing techniques used.

Collecting New Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When available data is insufficient or inappropriate for answering our research question, new data must be collected. 
Studies involving new data collection can be classified into two major branches:

* Observational studies
* Experimental studies

In the remainder of this section, we will briefly describe the characteristics of each and highlight their differences.
Because experimental studies require greater and more deliberate researcher intervention, their details will be discussed
further in Sections 8.2 through 8.5.

Observational Studies
-----------------------------------

In an **observational study**, researchers act as careful observers rather than active manipulators. 
They identify subjects of interest, contact them, and collect measurements, but they do not impose 
treatments or attempt to influence the study environment. This approach is particularly valuable 
when interventions would be unethical, impractical, or impossible, or when the research goal is to 
understand naturally occurring phenomena.

The observational approach follows a systematic process:

1. Define the research question.
2. Identify the target population.
3. Specify variables of interest, including both the primary variables of focus and potential 
   confounding variables that might influence the results.
4. Design and implement random sampling procedures to obtain a representative sample from the target population.
5. Observe and measure the variables of interest without intervention.
6. Apply statistical inference methods to draw conclusions about the broader population.

Strengths and Limitations of Observational Studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Observational studies excel at documenting naturally occurring relationships and patterns. They allow researchers 
to study phenomena in realistic settings where all the complex factors that influence outcomes in the real world 
remain present. This ecological validity makes observational studies particularly valuable for understanding how 
variables relate in natural environments.

A key limitation, however, is the lack of control over variables and treatment assignments. Without the ability 
to regulate which factors are present or how they vary, researchers cannot isolate the effects of specific 
conditions. As a result, the influence of other, uncontrolled factors may be difficult to separate from the patterns of interest.

This limitation does not reduce the value of observational studies; it simply calls for careful interpretation. 
Patterns observed consistently across multiple well-designed observational studies can still provide strong 
insights into how phenomena unfold in realistic contexts.

.. admonition:: Example üí°: The Case of "Feline High-rise Syndrome" üêà
   :class: note

   Consider the study of "feline high-rise syndrome" by Whitney and Mehlhaff, 
   published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical 
   Association in 1987. The researchers wondered: when cats fall from buildings, 
   how does the height of the fall relate to the severity of 
   their injuries? To investigate this question, they identified 132 cats that had been brought to 
   the Animal Medical Center in New York City after falling from multi-story buildings between June and November 1984. 
   For each case, they carefully documented the cat's injuries, the height from 
   which it fell, and the outcome of treatment.

   Their findings were surprising. About 90% of the cats survived their falls with appropriate veterinary care. 
   But more intriguingly, they observed that cats falling from seven 
   stories or higher didn't sustain significantly more injuries than those falling from lower heights. In fact, 
   cats falling from very high stories (nine floors or more) showed remarkably few limb fractures compared to 
   those falling from intermediate heights.

   The researchers proposed what they called the "terminal velocity hypothesis" to explain this pattern. They 
   theorized that cats reach their maximum falling speed after about five stories. Once they 
   achieve this terminal velocity and realize they're in for a long fall, cats may relax into a 
   "flying squirrel" posture that distributes impact forces more evenly across their body, reducing the 
   likelihood of concentrated injuries.

   **Why This Had to Be Observational**

   This study illustrates why observational research is sometimes the only ethical option. Testing 
   the terminal velocity hypothesis experimentally would require deliberately dropping cats from various 
   heights‚Äîan approach that would be both unethical and illegal. Even if researchers could design some sort 
   of controlled falling scenario with safety nets or other protections, such an artificial setup would 
   fundamentally change the phenomenon being studied. Instead, the researchers had to rely on cats' own 
   decisions to fall from high ledges, windowsills, and fire escapes.


Experimental Studies
--------------------------

When ethical and practical constraints allow, experimental studies offer the strongest framework for 
statistical investigation. In contrast to observational studies, experiments involve deliberate control 
over one or more variables, including the ability to assign treatments or conditions to subjects according 
to a planned design. This control enables researchers to minimize the influence of extraneous factors and 
ensure that differences in outcomes can be more confidently attributed to the conditions under study.

The following sections will expand on this topic in greater detail.

Bringing It All Together
----------------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways üìù
   :class: important

   1. **Statistical questions** require data with inherent variability and seek to quantify 
      relationships among variables.
   
   2. **Data sources vary in quality and appropriateness**: anecdotal data provides inspiration but 
      not evidence; available data offers efficiency but requires careful quality assessment; 
      new data collection provides control but demands resources.
   
   3. **Observational studies** can establish associations between variables but cannot definitively 
      prove causal relationships, making them valuable for studying naturally occurring phenomena where 
      intervention is impossible or unethical.
   
   4. **Experimental studies** can establish causal relationships by actively manipulating variables while 
      controlling other factors, making them the gold standard when ethical and practical constraints allow.
   
   5. **The choice between observational and experimental approaches** depends on research goals, 
      ethical considerations, and practical constraints.
   
   6. **Study design determines the scope of valid conclusions**: the methods used to collect data determine 
      which statistical analyses are appropriate and what kinds of inferences can be drawn.

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Study Classification**: For each scenario below, identify whether the research question is statistical 
   or deterministic, and explain your reasoning:
   
   a) Does the amount of fertilizer applied to tomato plants affect their yield?
   b) What is the area of a circular garden with radius 5 feet?
   c) Are taller basketball players more likely to be successful free-throw shooters?
   d) How much interest will $1000 earn in one year at 3% annual interest?

2. **Observational vs. Experimental**: Explain why each research question would likely require an observational 
   rather than experimental approach:
   
   a) Do people who smoke have higher rates of lung cancer?
   b) Are children from single-parent households more likely to experience academic difficulties?
   c) Does exposure to air pollution affect respiratory health?
   d) Do people who exercise regularly live longer?
