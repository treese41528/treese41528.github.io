Sampling Design
============================

**How we select experimental units** for our studies fundamentally determines whether our conclusions 
can be generalized beyond the specific individuals we observe.
The transition from experimental design to sampling design marks a shift from internal validity
to external validity. While experimental design principles ensure that our comparisons are fair and unbiased, 
sampling design principles ensure that our participants represent the population we want to understand.

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   * Understand that certain assumptions for valid statistical inference can only be satisfied through
     careful sampling design.
   * Recognize the serious **limitaions of non-random sampling methods**, which often introduce
     bias in the sample.
   * Learn the definitions of two major random sampling methods—**Simple Random Sampling and Stratified
     Random Sampling**—and understand the advantages and limitations of each.

Why Does the Sampling Design Matter?
-----------------------------------------------

The Connection to IID Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mathematical tools we use for drawing conclusions all depend on specific assumptions about how our data 
are collected. When these assumptions are violated, even the most sophisticated analysis can produce misleading results.

In particular, most statistical inference procedures covered in this course
rely on the Central Limit Theorem, which assumes that the observations are 
**independent and identically distributed (iid)**. This condition can only be ensured only during
the sampling stage.

The Population-Sample-Population Cycle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Statistical inference follows a logical cycle that depends entirely on proper sampling design:

   :alt: Diagram illustrating two samples with different degrees of generalizability

   Simple illustration of generalizability

1. **Define the target population** we want to understand
2. **Draw a representative sample** from that population using appropriate methods
3. **Analyze the sample data** using statistical procedures
4. **Generalize results back to the target population** with known levels of uncertainty

Each step depends on the previous ones. If our sample isn't representative of our target population 
(step 2), then our analysis (step 3) and conclusions (step 4) will be invalid, no matter how sophisticated 
our statistical methods.

Non-Random Sampling Methods: Understanding the Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------

Convenience Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Convenience sampling** selects participants based solely on ease of access and availability. 
This approach is attractive because it's simple, fast, and inexpensive to implement, making it 
tempting for researchers with limited resources or tight timelines.

.. admonition:: Example 💡: Convenience Sampling
   :class: note

   **Academic Research**: A psychology professor studies decision-making by recruiting students 
   from her own classes. While convenient, this sample only represents college students in that 
   particular major at that specific institution.

   **Medical Research**: A doctor studies the effectiveness of a new treatment by enrolling 
   patients who visit his clinic. This sample may systematically exclude people who can't 
   afford medical care, live far from the clinic, or prefer different healthcare providers.

   **Market Research**: A company surveys customers who visit their website or respond to email 
   invitations. This approach misses potential customers who don't engage with the company online.

   **Political Polling**: News outlets conduct "person on the street" interviews in busy downtown 
   areas. Such samples systematically overrepresent people who work downtown, have flexible schedules, 
   and are comfortable talking to reporters.

Voluntary Response Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Voluntary response sampling** occurs when individuals self-select into the study based on their 
own willingness or motivation to participate. 

.. admonition:: Example 💡: Voluntary Response
   :class: note

   **Political Issues**: When news programs ask viewers to call in with their opinions on political topics, 
   respondents typically have much stronger views than the general population. The results often show more 
   extreme positions than scientific polls of the same topics.

   **Product Reviews**: Online product reviews suffer from voluntary response bias because people with 
   very positive or very negative experiences are much more likely to write reviews than those with 
   neutral experiences.

   **Comment Sections**: Online comment sections on news articles or social media posts systematically 
   overrepresent people with strong opinions and those comfortable expressing views in public forums.

Limitations of Non-random Sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As seen in each example, non-random sampling methods are highly likely to produce bias in the 
observed sample. While these techniques can be useful for generating hypotheses or conducting 
preliminary studies, researchers should exercise caution when interpreting the validity of 
analyses based on data collected through non-random methods.

Random Sampling Methods: The Foundation of Valid Inference
------------------------------------------------------------

Randomization in sampling serves the same fundamental purpose as randomization in experimental design: 
it removes systematic bias and replaces it with known, manageable random variation. When we can't control 
all the factors that might affect who ends up in our sample, randomization ensures that these factors 
balance out across many possible samples.

**Key Properties of Random Sampling**

* **Known Selection Probabilities**: For every member of the population, we can calculate the probability 
  that they'll be included in our sample. This probabilistic foundation enables statistical inference.

* **Unbiased Selection**: The sampling process doesn't systematically favor any particular type of person 
  or outcome. Any biases that remain are due to random chance rather than systematic factors.

* **Quantifiable Uncertainty**: Because we understand the probabilistic mechanism that generated our 
  sample, we can calculate the uncertainty associated with our estimates and test results.

* **Reproducible Methods**: Random sampling procedures can be described precisely and replicated by other 
  researchers, enabling scientific verification of results.

* **Independence**: When properly implemented, random sampling ensures that the selection of one unit 
  doesn't influence the probability of selecting any other unit (or provides a close approximation to independence).

A. Simple Random Sampling: The Gold Standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Simple Random Sampling

**Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** represents the conceptual foundation for most statistical inference 
procedures. In SRS, every possible unit in the population has exactly the same probability of being 
selected, and every possible sample of a given size has exactly the same probability of being chosen.

**Implementation Procedure**

Suppose a simple random sample of size :math:`n` is to be 
taken from a population of size :math:`N`.

* **Step 1**: Define the target population.

* **Step 2**: Give each unit in the population a unique identifier. This can be:

   - Sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, ..., N)
   - Existing ID numbers (SSN, student ID, account numbers)
   - Systematic codes that preserve anonymity while maintaining uniqueness

* **Step 3**: Use a random process to select which identifiers will be included. In this step,

   - Every individual in the population should have probability :math:`\frac{n}{N}` of being included in the sample.
   - Equivalently, every possible sample of size :math:`n` should have probability 
     :math:`1/\binom{N}{n}` of being selected.

B. Stratified Random Sampling: Balancing Representation and Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter8/stratified-random-sampling.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: Diagram of stratified random sampling
   
   Stratified Random Sampling

When populations contain important subgroups that differ substantially from each other, 
**stratified random sampling** provides a method for ensuring adequate representation of all 
subgroups. It divides the population into **strata** (subgroups) 
based on characteristics known before sampling, then gathers separate simple random samples within each stratum.

The sizes of the sub-samples may be uniform or vary across strata. When they differ, 
the allocation is often proportional to the relative sizes of the strata in the population.

   - * Method
     * Advantages
     * Limitations
   
   - * Simple Random Sampling
     * It is simple in construction.
     * It can miss a rare but significant subgroup from the population when the sample size
       is not large enough.
   
   - * Stratified Random Sampling
     * It can ensure representation of important subgroups in the population.
     * It requires more planning than simple random sampling.
       
       - Which subgroups will be used as strata? 
       - How will the sample size be allocated to each stratum?

     

Bringing It All Together
--------------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. The methods used to select participants fundamentally determine whether statistical 
      inference procedures are **valid** and whether results can be **generalized**.
   
   2. **Non-random sampling creates systematic bias**: Convenience and voluntary response sampling are 
      simple and cheap but introduce biases, limiting their use to preliminary investigations.
   
   3. **Random sampling methods** provide the probabilistic foundation required for statistical inference procedures.
   
   4. **Simple random sampling** gives every population member equal selection probability and 
      satisfies the iid assumptions required for most statistical procedures.
   
   5. When populations contain distinct subgroups, **stratified random sampling** can be used to control the balance 
      among subgroups.
