The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
====================================================

We've established that the sampling distribution of :math:`\bar{X}` is normal when the population is normal. 
Then what about cases where the **population is not normally distributed**? 
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a pivotal concept in statistics that addresses this question.

.. admonition:: Road Map üß≠
   :class: important

   * Learn the formal statement of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). 
   * Recognize the experimental settings where the CLT applies. 
   * Apply the CLT to compute approximate probabilities of the sample mean.

The Formal Statement of the CLT
-----------------------------------

For an *independent and identically distributed (iid)* random sample :math:`X_1, X_2, ..., X_n` 
from a population with a finite mean :math:`Œº` and finite standard deviation :math:`œÉ`,

.. math::

   \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1) \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty

.. admonition:: What does this all mean? üîé
   :class: important

   * :math:`\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}` is the *standardized sample mean*. 
     :math:`\bar{X}` is subtracted by its own mean :math:`\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu`, 
     then divided by its own standard deviation :math:`\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}` (the standard error).

   * :math:`\xrightarrow{d}` indicates *convergence in distribution*.

   * Putting together, the mathematical statement reads: "The distribution of the standardized sample mean
     approaches standard normal as the sample size :math:`n` goes to infinity."

Practical Implications of the CLT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When 

1. the population has a **finite mean** :math:`\mu` and a **finite standard deviation** :math:`\sigma`,
2. the observations are **independent and identically distributed (iid)**, and
3. the sample size :math:`n` is **sufficiently large**,

we have
 

.. math::
   \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \stackrel{d}{\approx} Z, 

where :math:`\stackrel{d}{\approx}` indicates that the two random variables have **similar** distributions.
By applying the same linear operations on both sides, we can
equivalently write:

.. math::
   \bar{X} \stackrel{d}{\approx} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} Z + \mu.

The right-hand side is a linear transformation of a standard normal random variable
with the distribution :math:`N(\mu, \sigma/\sqrt{n})`. It follows that:

.. math::
   \bar{X} \stackrel{\text{approx}}{\sim} N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right).

Visual Demonstrations
--------------------------------------

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a 
normal distribution as the sample size increases, **regardless of the shape of the population distribution**, 
as long as certain conditions are met. Let us use a visual tool to build intuition for this somewhat surprising result.

How to Use the Simulation Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation tool requires a few inputs.

.. flat-table::
   :width: 100%
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Description
     - How to use

   * - **Population Distribution**
     - Normal, uniform, exponential, etc.
     - Select the family of distributions from which samples will be generated

   * - **Population Parameters**
     - Different for each population family (e.g., :math:`\mu` and :math:`\sigma` for normal, :math:`\lambda` for exponential)
     - Select the specific distribution belonging to the chosen family

   * - **Sample Size** :math:`n`
     - The number of data points used to compute one sample mean
     - Increase from small to large. Observe the change in the sampling distribution
   
   * - **Number of Samples**
     - The number of different sample means used to construct a histogram of the sampling distribution
     - Fix at a large number (10000, for example) so the sampling distribution of of sample means is 
       sufficiently described.

Once all values are set as desired, click **simulate**. Two plots will display:

* A pdf/pmf plot of the population distribution
* A histogram of sample means drawn from the population

A Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By experimenting with different settings, confirm the following:

.. flat-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%

   * - ‚úî‚ùì
     - To confirm

   * -
     - The CLT indeed holds. That is, the histogram of sample means approaches a normal shape
       as :math:`n` grows.
   
   * -
     - A *large enough* :math:`n`, which makes the histogram look sufficiently normal, is different
       for each population distribution. In general, a population requires a larger :math:`n` if 
       it has strong non-normal characteristics (asymetry, multimodality, etc.).

   * - 
     - the center of the histogram remains around :math:`\mu` while the spread (:math:`\sigma/\sqrt{n}`) narrows around
       :math:`\mu` as :math:`n` increases.

How Large is "Sufficiently Large"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The common rule of thumb that n > 30 is sufficient should not be blindly applied. 
As we saw through simulations, the appropriate sample size depends entirely on the underlying population distribution. 
The farther the population distribution is from normal, the larger the sample size needed for the CLT to apply effectively.

In practice, **we only observe a single sample from a population**. Our understanding of the 
population depends on the sample we observe and our background knowledge. We must explore our sample carefully
to determine if the sample size is likely sufficient for the CLT to apply.

Step-by-Step Problem Solving with the CLT
-----------------------------------------------

Problems using the CLT follow the general steps below:

1. Verify that the prerequisites for the CLT are met.
2. Identify the population mean :math:`\mu_X` and standard deviation :math:`\sigma_X`, and
   use them to calculate the mean :math:`\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu_X` and 
   the standard error :math:`\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sigma_X/\sqrt{n}` of the sampling distribution.
3. Establish the approximate sampling distribution of the sample mean: :math:`\bar{X} \stackrel{\text{approx}}{\sim} N(\mu_{\bar{X}}, \sigma_{\bar{X}})`.
4. Use a standard normal table or software to find the required probability.


.. admonition:: Exampleüí°: Another Maze Navigation Example
   :class: note 

   The same subspecies of rat from the previous experiment will be forced to navigate a more complex maze in which 
   a wrong turn early on can drastically increase the time to completion. The true mean completion time for
   the whole population of the subspecies is known to be 10 minutes. The true standard deviation is 3 minutes. 
   It is also known that the distribution is slightly right skewed. 

   Suppose that 60 rats are randomly selected from the population to navigate the maze.

   a) What is the mean of the **average time** it takes 60 rats to navigate the maze?
   b) What is the standard deviation of the **average time**?
   c) What is the probability that the **average maze navigation time** for the 60 rats is greater than 11 minutes?
   
   **Organize the Given Information**

   We know that the distribution of the population :math:`X` is slightly right skewed. Further, :math:`\mu_X=10` and :math:`\sigma_X=3`.
   
   **Solve the Problems**

   a) :math:`\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu_{X} = 10`

   b) :math:`\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma_X}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{60}}=0.3878`

   c) We do not know the population distribution, so we hope to use the CLT to compute the probability. We must first confirm that
      all the conditions are met for the CLT to hold:

      1. The population mean and standard deviation are finite. ‚úî
      2. The sample was formed by taking random samples from the same population. The randmonness ensures that
         the selection of one rat does not influence others (independence). Since they come from the same population,
         their distributions are identical. ‚úî
      3. For a *slightly* skewed distribution, :math:`n=60` is large enough. (To confirm, try plotting a left-skewed beta case with
         :math:`\alpha=3, \beta=2` using the simulation tool above). ‚úî

      Therefore, :math:`\bar{X} \stackrel{\text{approx}}{\sim} N(\mu_{X}=10, \sigma_{\bar{X}}=0.3878)` by the CLT. Then

      .. math::
         P(\bar{X} > 11) &= 1 - P(\bar{X} \leq 11) \\
         &= 1 - P\left(Z \leq \frac{11-10}{3/\sqrt{60}}\right) \\
         &= 1-\Phi(2.58) = 0.0049



Bringing It All Together
---------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways üìù
   :class: important

   1. **The Central Limit Theorem states** that for an iid sample from a population with finite mean and variance, 
      the distribution of the standardized sample mean approaches standard normal as the sample size increases.
   
   2. **The CLT can be used to approximate the sampling distribution of** :math:`\bar{X}`, 
      but the sample size needed depends on how far the population distribution deviates from normality.
   
The Central Limit Theorem represents one of the most powerful and remarkable results in statistics. 
It allows us to use the normal distribution as a foundation for statistical inference across a wide 
range of real-world situations, even when the underlying population distributions are unknown or non-normal.
