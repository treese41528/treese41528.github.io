Basic Set Theory
==============================

We are now ready to delve into the mathematical framework of describing uncertainty—namely, 
probability theory. We begin by developing the basic vocabulary of set theory. 

.. admonition:: Road Map 🧭
   :class: important

   • Define **experiments**, **sample spaces**, and **events** as the building blocks of probability.
   • Explore set operations: **complement**, **union**, and **intersection**.
   • Visualize set relationships using **Venn diagrams**.
   • Understand the basic rules governing set operations.

Basic Terminology and Notation
-------------------------------------------------

Random Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **Random experiment** is a repeatable process with at least two possible outcomes, 
and where the result of any single run cannot be predicted with certainty.

Examples of random experiments include:

* Rolling a die
* Flipping a coin
* Measuring the height of a randomly selected student
* Observing whether a manufactured part is defective

Sample space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **sample space** is the *set* of all possible outcomes in a random experiment.

A **set** is a mathematical object represnting a *collection* of objects. 
It is conventionally named with a capital letter. 
When listing its elements, we enclose them in a pair of curly brackets,
:math:`\{\cdots\}`. 

Because the sample space is a **special set** in probability, we set aside the letters
:math:`S` or :math:`\Omega` (Omega) for it and rarely use them to name other sets.
When referring to an arbitrary single outcome in a sample space, we use the lower case Greek letter
:math:`\omega` (omega). 

To express that an outcome belongs to a set, we use the notation :math:`\in`. For example,

.. math:: \omega \in \Omega.

Trial
~~~~~~~~
A **trial** refers to a single execution of a random experiment. 

Event
~~~~~~~~~

An **Event** is a *set* of outcomes. 
An event can be

* a **simple event** consisting of a single outcome,
* a set as large as the whole sample space, or
* an **empty set** (denoted by :math:`\emptyset` or :math:`\{\}`).
   
An empty set is a valid event representing the set of "impossible" outcomes
in the experiment.

Events are denoted by capital letters other than the ones set aside for the sample space.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Using Set Theory Terminology and Notation Correctly
   :class: note
   
   1. Suppose a 20-sided die is being rolled. Identify the random experiment, trial and sample
   space.

   The random experiment is the action of rolling a 20-sided die. A trial consists of rolling
   the die once then observing the outcome. Its sample space can be denoted as:

      .. math::

         \Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\}


   2. Name the events corresponding to

      a) "rolling an even number"
      b) "rolling a value of at least 21"
      c)  "rolling a perfect 20"
      d) "rolling a number" 
      
      and list their elements using the correct set theory notation.

      Denote the events described in parts (a)-(d) with capital letters :math:`A` - :math:`D`,
      respectively. 
         
      * :math:`A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\}`.
      * :math:`B = \{\}` or  :math:`B=\emptyset` because there is no outcome 
        in the sample space :math:`\Omega` which fits the description. It is an "impossible"
        event.
      * :math:`C = \{20\}`. It is a simple event.
      * :math:`D = \Omega` since any outcome in the sample space fits the description.      


Visualizing Sets with Venn Diagrams
--------------------------------------

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/basic-venn.png
   :alt: a simple venn diagram
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 30%

   A simple venn diagram


**Venn diagrams** provide a visual tool for understanding relationships between sets. 
A Venn diagram is constructed based on the following rules:

* The sample space is represented with a rectangle.
* Events are represented as circles inside the rectangle.
* In general, two events are drawn to slightly overlap with each other
  to account for any outcomes that might belong to both.
* All shapes must be labeled.

Core Set Operations
----------------------

The power of set theory lies in the operations that allow us to **construct 
new sets from existing ones**. This section introduces some of the most fundamental of
such operations. 

Complement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/complement-venn.png
   :alt: venn diagram with A complement highlighted
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 30%

   Complement of A

The complement of an event :math:`A`, denoted :math:`A'` (read as "A prime" or "A complement"), 
consists of the outcomes in the sample space that are **not in A**.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Complement
   :class: note

   Find the complements of events :math:`A` - :math:`D` from the previous example. 

   a) :math:`A' = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19\}`.
   b) :math:`B' = \Omega` since all outcomes are not in event B.
   c) :math:`C' = \{1, 2, \cdots, 19\}`.
   d) :math:`D' = \emptyset`.

Union
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/union-venn.png
   :alt: venn diagram with the union of A and B highlighted
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 30%

   Union of A and B

The **union** of events :math:`A` and :math:`B`, denoted :math:`A \cup B`, 
contains all outcomes that belong to either A **or** B **or** both.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Union
   :class: note

   Suppose a 20-sided die is being rolled. Continue using the events 
   :math:`A` - :math:`D` defined in the first example.

   #. Define a new event :math:`E` consisting of all outcomes less than 6. Find the
      union of each of :math:`A` - :math:`D` with :math:`E`.


      Begin by writing down the elements of :math:`E` formally:

      .. math:: E = \{1,2,3,4,5\}.

      a) :math:`A \cup E = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20\}`.
      b) :math:`B \cup E = \emptyset \cup E = \{1,2,3,4,5\} = E`.
      c) :math:`C \cup E = \{1,2,3,4,5,20\}`.
      d) :math:`D \cup E = \Omega \cup E = \Omega`.

   #. In general, what is the union of an event and its complement?

      A set and its "everything else" make up a whole together. The union of an event with
      its complement is always the sample space. 
      

Intersection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/intersection-venn.jpg
   :alt: venn diagram with the intersection of A and B highlighted
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 30%

   Intersection of A and B

The **intersection** of events :math:`A` and :math:`B`, denoted :math:`A \cap B`, 
contains the outcomes that belong to both A **and** B.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Intersection
   :class: note

   Suppose a 20-sided die is being rolled. Continue using the events 
   :math:`A` - :math:`E` defined in the previous examples.

   #. Find the intersection of each of :math:`A` - :math:`D` with :math:`E`.
      
      a) :math:`A \cap E = \{2,4\}`
      b) :math:`B \cap E = \emptyset \cap E= \emptyset` because the overlap of "nothing" with :math:`E` is still "nothing"!
      c) :math:`C \cap E = \emptyset`. The two events have no shared elements.
      d) :math:`D \cap E = \Omega \cap E = \{1,2,3,4,5\} = E`. The entirety of :math:`E` is an overlap between
         :math:`D` and :math:`E`.

   #. In general, what is the intersection of an event and its complement?

      If an outcome belongs to an event, it cannot belong to the complement, and vice versa. 
      Therfore, the intersection of an event and its complement is always an empty set.
      


Mutually Exclusive Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/disjoint-venn.png
   :alt: venn diagram of mutually exclusive events
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 40%

   Mutually exclusive events

When two events cannot happen simultaneously, we call them **mutually exclusive**
or **disjoint**. Since no outcome can belong to both sets at the same time, **their intersection is always
an empty set**. In mathematical notation, if events :math:`A` and :math:`B` are
mutually exclusive, we write

.. math:: A \cap B = \emptyset.

To express this special relationship graphically, we draw disjoint events as non-overlapping
regions on a Venn diagram.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Mutually Exclusive Sets
   :class: note

   1. Among the previously defined events :math:`A,B, \cdots, E`, can you identify any
      pair of events that are mutually exclusive?

      * :math:`C \cap E = \emptyset` because they do not have any common outcomes.
      * :math:`A,C,D,E` are all disjoint with :math:`B=\emptyset` because the pairwise
        intersections are an empty set.

Subsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/subset-venn.png
   :alt: Venn diagram showing set C as a subset of set A
   :align: center
   :width: 40%

   C is a subset of A (C ⊆ A)


We say :math:`A` is a **subset** of :math:`B`, and write :math:`A \subseteq B`, if every outcome in :math:`A` is also in :math:`B`.
In other words, the whole set **A** is a part of the set **B**.

On a Venn diagram, we express the relationship by drawing the smaller set as completely enclosed
in the larger set.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Subsets
   :class: note

   1. Among the previously defined events :math:`A,B, \cdots, E`, can you identify an event
      that is a subset of another event?

      * :math:`C \subseteq A` because the outcome 20 makes up the whole event :math:`C` but
        also belongs to the event :math:`A`.
      * All events are a subet of :math:`D=\Omega`.
      * Each event is a subset of itself because every outcome in :math:`A` is also in :math:`A`!
      * :math:`B = \emptyset` is a subset of any other event. (This one requires a more 
        subtle argument which we will not go through now. It is included for the 
        completeness of the example.)

Extending Operations to Multiple Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The union and intersection operations can be extended to multiple events using indexing notation.

A **union of** :math:`n` **events** :math:`A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n` contains the outcomes which belong to 
:math:`A_1, A_2, \cdots`, **or** :math:`A_n`. It is written as

.. _multi-union:
.. math::

   \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_n.


An **intersection of** :math:`n` **events** :math:`A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n` contains the outcomes which belong to
**all of** :math:`A_1, A_2, \cdots`, **and** :math:`A_n`. It is denoted by

.. _multi-intersection:
.. math::

   \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n.

..
   When the union of events equals the entire sample space (⋃ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Aᵢ = S), 
   we say the collection of events is **exhaustive**. The simplest example of exhaustive events 
   is an event and its complement (A ∪ A^c = S).

.. admonition:: Important tip 🛑
   :class: danger

   Being able to **move fluently between plain-language descriptions** of complex events 
   and **their mathematical notation** is a vital skill. Recall that the three core set 
   operations—**complement, union, and intersection**—correspond directly to the key 
   words **"not", "or", and "and"**, respectively. 
   Keep these translations in mind when approaching word problems. 

Algebra of Sets
-----------------

Set operations follow specific algebraic laws that parallel those in ordinary arithmetic. 
Understanding these laws will allow us to manipulate complex set expressions more efficiently.

Commutative Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a union or intersection of a pair of events, their order does not matter.

.. math::

   A \cup B = B \cup A \\
   A \cap B = B \cap A

Associative Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we have **multiple operations of the same type** (all unions or all intersections), 
the order of pairwise operations does not matter.

.. math::

   (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C) \\
   (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)

* Parentheses indicate that any operations inside must be prioritized over
  the ones outside.

When dealing with a sequence of the same operation, this property allows us to
place parentheses wherever we want without changing the result. 
For example, when taking the union of three sets, we could first unite A and B and then 
unite the result with C, or we could first unite B and C and then unite A with that 
result—the final set will be identical either way.


.. admonition:: Remark: Justifying the Multiset Notation
   :class: important

   Recall the :math:`n`-event extensions of union and intersection from above.

   .. math::

      \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n

   .. math::

      \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n

   We already accepted these as true, but they in fact
   require the commutative and associative laws to be well-defined.
   Without the associative property, we would need to specify the exact order of
   pairwise operations using multiple sets of parentheses. The commutative property 
   allows us to index the events in any way without changing the result.

Distributive Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The distributive laws apply when **when unions and intersections are used together**.

.. math::

   A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \\
   A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)

They are called "distributive" because one operation distributes over the other, 
similar to how multiplication distributes over addition in algebra 
(:math:`a(b + c) = a b + a c`).

Let us confirm these laws through a concrete example.

.. admonition:: Example💡: Distributive laws

   Suppose we are rolling a 6-sided die.
   Take the events A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {2, 3, 4}, and C = {3, 4, 5}. Compute 
   :math:`A \cup (B \cap C)` directly AND using the appropriate
   distributive law. Confirm that the two methods yield an identical outcome.

   **Computing** :math:`A \cup (B \cap C)` **directly**
   
   :math:`B \cap C = \{3,4\}`. Then :math:`A \cup (B \cap C) = \{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{3,4\} = \{1,2,3,4\}`. 

   **Using the distributive law**
   
   Let us compute the right hand side of the first law, :math:`(A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C).`
   First, :math:`A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}` and :math:`A \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}`. Then
   
   .. math:: (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \cap \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.

   Yes, the two methods give the same answer.

The distributive laws extend to multiple sets as well:

.. math::

   A \cup \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} B_i\right) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} (A \cup B_i)

.. math::

   A \cap \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} B_i\right) = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} (A \cap B_i)

De Morgan's Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

De Morgan's laws are a tool for manipulating **complements of unions and intersections**.

**De Morgan's First Law**:

.. math::

   (A \cup B)' = A' \cap B' 

In plain language, this means that for an outcome to be excluded from "A or B," 
it must be excluded from both A and B. 

**De Morgan's Second Law**:

.. math::

   (A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'

This means that for an outcome to be excluded from "A and B," it is sufficient 
to be excluded from either A or B (or both).

.. admonition:: Example💡: De Morgan's Laws
   :class: note

   Let us continue to consider the random experiment of rolling a six-sided die. Define new events:
   
   - :math:`D = \{5,6\}` (the event of rolling a number greater than 4)
   - :math:`E = \{2, 4, 6\}` (the event of rolling an even number)

   1. Find :math:`(D \cap E)'` directly and using the appropriate De Margan's law. Confirm that
   the two methods yield the same answer.

      **Finding** :math:`(D \cap E)'` **directly**:

      :math:`(D \cap E)=\{6\}`. Then :math:`(D \cap E)'=\{1,2,3,4,5\}`.

      **Using De Morgan's second law**:

      :math:`D' = \{1,2,3,4\}` and :math:`E' = \{1,3,5\}`. 
      Therefore, :math:`D' \cup E' = \{1,2,3,4\} \cup \{1,3,5\} =\{1,2,3,4,5\}`.

      Yes, the two approaches result in the same answer.

   2. Try verifying De Morgan's first law as an independent exercise.

The multi-event form of De Morgan's first law is:

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/first-de-morgan-multi.png
   :alt: Multi-event first De Morgan's Law
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 23%

   Multi-event first De Morgan's Law

.. math::

   \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i\right)' = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i'

This reads as "the complement of the union of :math:`n` events equals the intersection of the 
complements of those :math:`n` events." In other words, for an outcome to be outside the union of all events, 
it must be outside each individual event.

The multi-event form of De Morgan's second law is:

.. math::

   \left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i\right)' = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i'

.. figure:: https://yjjpfnblgtrogqvcjaon.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/stat-350-assets/images/chapter4/second-de-morgan-multi.png
   :alt: Multi-event second De Morgan's Law
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 20%

   Multi-event second De Morgan's Law

This reads as "the complement of the intersection of :math:`n` events equals the union of the complements 
of those :math:`n` events." This means an outcome is outside the intersection of all events if it's outside 
at least one of the individual events.

Bringing It All Together
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways 📝
   :class: important

   1. **Random experiments** produce outcomes with uncertainty; 
      the complete collection of possible outcomes forms the **sample space**.
   
   2. **Events** are subsets of the sample space, representing collections of outcomes we're interested in studying.
   
   3. The fundamental set operations—**complement**, **union**, and **intersection**—allow us to 
      create new events from existing ones.
   
   4. **Venn diagrams** provide a visual representation of set relationships.
   
   5. Set operations follow **algebraic laws** similar to those 
      in ordinary arithmetic.
   
   6. **De Morgan's laws** provide tools for manipulating complex expressions by relating 
      complements of unions and intersections.

In the next chapter, we'll assign numerical measures to events, allowing us to quantify uncertainty with probability. 
The set operations we've learned will become the building blocks for the probability rules that govern statistical 
inference.
