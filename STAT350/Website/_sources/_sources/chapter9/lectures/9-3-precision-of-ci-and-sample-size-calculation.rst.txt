Precision of a Confidence Interval
=============================================================================

In the previous section, we established that confidence intervals convey 
the **degree of uncertainty** through their width.
A narrow interval suggests high precision, while a wide interval reflects greater uncertainty.
This naturally raises two key questions: 

* What factors determine the width of a confidence interval?
* What can we do to make an interval more precise (narrower)?
 
We will explore the answers to these questions in this lesson.

   * Identify the **three building blocks of a margin of error** and understand how each influences the
     precision of a confidence interval.
   * Understand why the sample size is the only component of an ME that researchers can actively control.
   * For a desired level of precision, **compute the mininum required sample size**, and 
     incorporate this into experiment planning.

What Makes a Confidence Interval Precise?

   The width of a confidence interval is equal to 2ME

The width of a confidence interval is entirely determined by its margin of error (ME) as shown in
:numref:`CI-ME`. Specifically,

.. math::
   \text{width of a CI} = 2ME = 2z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.

From its mathematical definition, we can identify **three elements** that
determine the size of an ME: :math:`\alpha` (and thus :math:`C`), :math:`\sigma`, and :math:`n`.
Let us examine how each affects the width of a confidence interval.

       lower precision

   * - Sample size :math:`n`
     - Higher :math:`n \to` decreased ME & higher precision 



Controlling the Precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of the three components of a margin of error,
**researchers can practically control only the sample size,** :math:`n`. 
The population standard deviation :math:`\sigma`
is a fixed property of the population, and the confidence level :math:`C` must be chosen
to reflect the desired rigor of the experiment; it is not meaningful to lower confidence merely to
obtain a narrower interval.

This leads to an important practical question: "How do we control the sample size to meet a target precision?"

Sample Size Planning for a Target Precision 
-----------------------------------------------

Maximum Width
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose we want to construct a confidence interval whose width is at most :math:`w_{max}`. That is, 
we want

.. math::
   \text{width} = 2z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq w_{max}.

Rearranging to isolate :math:`n`,

.. math::
   \frac{2z_{\alpha/2}\sigma}{w_{max}} \leq \sqrt{n}.

Square both sides and bring :math:`n` to the left hand side:

.. math::
   n \geq \left(\frac{2 z_{\alpha/2} \sigma}{w_{max}}\right)^2.

Since :math:`n` must be a whole number, we take the **the smallest integer**
on or above the lower bound. That is, the smallest required sample size :math:`n^*` for
a target width :math:`w_{max}` is computed as:

.. math::
   n^* = \Bigg\lceil \left(\frac{2 z_{\alpha/2} \sigma}{w_{max}}\right)^2 \Bigg\rceil.

Maximum Margin of Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The desired level of precision can also be given as a maximum margin of error, :math:`\text{ME}_{max}`.
In this case, we take :math:`n^*` as:

.. math::
   n^* =   \Bigg\lceil\left(\frac{z_{\alpha/2} \sigma}{\text{ME}_{max}}\right)^2 \Bigg\rceil

through a similar flow of logic. You are encouraged to confirm this result as a quick exercise.

.. admonition:: Example üí°: Weights of American Adult Males, Continued
   :class: note

   We continue with the study of weights of American male adults from Section 9.2.
   Suppose the researchers want to compute a 99% confidence interval for 
   the mean weight with a **margin of error of at most 1**. What is the smallest sample size 
   they need?

   **The building blocks**

   * The maximum ME: :math:`\text{ME}_{max} = 1`.
   * The population standard deviation: :math:`\sigma=49.26` lbs
   * Confidence level: :math:`99\% \, (C=0.99, \alpha=0.01)`
   * The z-critical value: :math:`z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.005} = 2.5758`

   **The goal**

   We would like to compute the smallest integer :math:`n` satisfying

   .. math::
      ME = z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \text{ME}_{max}

   Rearranging and isolating :math:`n`,

   .. math::
      n \geq \left(\frac{z_{\alpha/2}\sigma}{ME_{max}}\right)^2 = 
      \left(\frac{(2.5758)(49.26)}{1}\right)^2 = 16099.53

   The smallest sample size
   needed for the desired level of precison is :math:`n^* = \lceil 16099.53\rceil =16,100`.

Bringing It All Together
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways üìù
   :class: important

   * The margin of error quantifies the precision of a confidence interval. 
     The three factors of margin of error that control precision are: 
     confidence level :math:`C`, population variance :math:`\sigma^2` (or population sd :math:`\sigma`),
     and sample size :math:`n`.
   * The smallest required sample size for a given maximum ME can be calculated using: 
     :math:`n^* = \Big\lceil \left(\frac{z_{\alpha/2}\,\sigma}{\text{ME}_{max}}\right)^2\Big\rceil`.

Exercises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Sample Size Planning**: A battery manufacturer wants to estimate the mean battery voltage with a margin of error of 
   :math:`0.05 V` at 99% confidence. Past data suggest :math:`\sigma = 0.21 V`. Calculate the required sample size.

2. **Cost-Effectiveness vs Precision**: Why is it generally not cost-effective to seek extremely narrow confidence intervals 
   (e.g., reducing margin of error below 1% of the estimate)? Provide both statistical and practical 
   justifications for your answer.
