Multiple Comparison Procedures and Family-Wise Error Rates
=========================================================================

After obtaining statistical significance in our analysis of variance procedure, we have determined 
that at least one of the means are different from the rest. However, this doesn't tell us which 
means are different, and it doesn't tell us that it's only one mean that's different from the rest‚Äîit 
could be that all of them are different. We need to explore further after we have obtained statistical 
significance to identify which means are different, which results in us performing what's called multiple 
comparison procedures.

   ‚Ä¢ **Problem we will solve** ‚Äì How to make multiple pairwise comparisons after ANOVA while controlling the overall probability of making Type I errors across all tests

   ‚Ä¢ **Tools we'll learn** ‚Äì Family-wise error rate concepts, ≈†id√°k and Bonferroni corrections, Tukey's HSD method, Dunnett's method, and graphical display techniques for post-hoc comparisons

   ‚Ä¢ **How it fits** ‚Äì This completes the ANOVA procedure by providing rigorous methods to identify specific group differences while maintaining statistical control, bridging the gap between detecting overall differences and understanding the structure of those differences

The Foundation: Why We Need Multiple Comparisons
------------------------------------------------

When ANOVA indicates statistical significance with a small p-value from our F-test statistic, we have rejected the null hypothesis :math:`H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k`. This tells us that at least one of the population means is different from the others, leading to the alternative hypothesis :math:`H_a: \mu_i \neq \mu_j` for some :math:`i \neq j`.

However, this global conclusion could mean several different things:

- Only one pair of means differs (e.g., :math:`\mu_1 \neq \mu_2` but :math:`\mu_3 = \mu_4 = \mu_5`)
- Multiple pairs differ but some remain equal (e.g., :math:`\mu_1 = \mu_2 \neq \mu_3 = \mu_4 \neq \mu_5`)
- All means are completely different from each other
- Any number of intermediate patterns

To understand the specific structure of these differences, we need to perform **multiple comparison procedures**‚Äîessentially conducting a series of focused two-sample tests comparing pairs of groups.

Visual Exploration Before Formal Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before diving into formal statistical procedures, we should return to our graphical displays to gain initial insights:

**Effects plots** display the sample means for each group without considering variability, making it easy to see which means are most separated. These plots help us identify the groups that appear most different visually.

**Side-by-side boxplots** allow us to consider both the separation of means and the variability within groups, helping us identify which differences are most likely to be statistically significant when we account for sampling variability.

In our coffeehouse example, the boxplots clearly showed that coffeehouses 2 and 4 had the most separated means relative to their within-group variability, suggesting these would likely be significantly different in formal testing.

The Fundamental Challenge: The Multiple Testing Problem
--------------------------------------------------------

The most natural approach might be to simply perform individual two-sample t-tests for every pair of groups using the pooled variance approach (since we've already established the equal variance assumption in ANOVA). However, this naive approach creates a serious **multiple testing problem**.

The Mathematical Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For :math:`k` groups, we need to perform :math:`c = \binom{k}{2} = \frac{k!}{(k-2)!2!}` different pairwise comparisons. Each comparison tests:

.. math::

   H_0^{(j)}: \mu_i = \mu_j \quad \text{vs} \quad H_a^{(j)}: \mu_i \neq \mu_j

for all pairs :math:`i > j`, where :math:`j = 1, 2, \ldots, c`.

Since we're building on ANOVA, we use the pooled variance confidence interval approach:

.. math::

   (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_j) \pm t_{\alpha/2,n-k} \sqrt{\text{MSE}\left(\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}\right)}

where MSE comes from our ANOVA table and the degrees of freedom are :math:`n-k` from our variance estimate.

The Problem: Type I Error Inflation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each individual test controls Type I error at level :math:`\alpha`. If we set :math:`\alpha = 0.05` for each test, then each test has a 5% chance of making a Type I error when its null hypothesis is true. However, when we perform many tests simultaneously, the overall probability of making **at least one** Type I error becomes much larger than 5%.

Let's examine this mathematically. For a concrete example, consider 5 groups requiring :math:`\binom{5}{2} = 10` pairwise comparisons. If we naively use :math:`\alpha = 0.05` for each test, what's the probability of making at least one Type I error across all 10 tests?

To understand this, let's think about the complementary event. The probability of making **no** Type I errors means that all 10 tests correctly fail to reject their respective null hypotheses. If we assume the tests are independent (a simplifying assumption we'll discuss), then:

.. math::

   P(\text{No Type I errors}) = P(\text{Test 1 correct}) \times P(\text{Test 2 correct}) \times \cdots \times P(\text{Test 10 correct})

.. math::

   = (1 - 0.05)^{10} = (0.95)^{10} = 0.599

Therefore:

.. math::

   P(\text{At least one Type I error}) = 1 - 0.599 = 0.401

This means we have about a 40% chance of making at least one false positive‚Äîfar above our intended 5% level! This massive inflation of Type I error rate undermines our statistical control and can lead to false discoveries.

Visualizing the Multiple Testing Problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine we have two simultaneous tests, represented by their test statistic distributions under their respective null hypotheses. Each distribution has rejection regions in its tails corresponding to :math:`\alpha/2` in each tail for a two-sided test.

The overall Type I error occurs when we reject at least one null hypothesis incorrectly. This happens in several scenarios:

- We make a Type I error in the first test but not the second
- We make a Type I error in the second test but not the first  
- We make Type I errors in both tests simultaneously

The total probability of "at least one error" encompasses all these scenarios and is much larger than the individual :math:`\alpha` level for any single test.

Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER): The Formal Framework
------------------------------------------------------

The **family-wise error rate (FWER)** provides a rigorous framework for understanding and controlling the overall Type I error rate across multiple tests.

Formal Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The family-wise error rate is the probability of making at least one Type I error across all comparisons in a family of tests, assuming all null hypotheses in the family are true:

.. math::

   \text{FWER} = P\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^c \{\text{Reject } H_0^{(j)}\} \Big| \text{All } H_0^{(j)} \text{ are true}\right)

This can be equivalently written as:

.. math::

   \text{FWER} = P(\text{At least one false positive}) = 1 - P(\text{No false positives})

Independence Assumption and Its Implications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we assume the :math:`c` tests are statistically independent and each has Type I error rate :math:`\alpha_{\text{single}}`, then:

.. math::

   P(\text{No false positives}) = \prod_{j=1}^c P(\text{Test } j \text{ correct}) = (1 - \alpha_{\text{single}})^c

Therefore:

.. math::

   \text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - \alpha_{\text{single}})^c

**Important caveat**: The independence assumption is actually quite unrealistic in our setting. The pairwise comparisons use overlapping data and share the common MSE estimate, creating dependencies between the tests. However, this assumption provides a useful starting point for understanding the problem and developing solutions.

The General Formula for Any Number of Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For :math:`k` groups requiring :math:`c = \binom{k}{2}` comparisons, if each test uses significance level :math:`\alpha_{\text{single}}`:

.. math::

   \text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - \alpha_{\text{single}})^c

This formula reveals how quickly the family-wise error rate grows as we increase either the number of groups or the individual test significance level.

Methods for Controlling FWER
----------------------------

Several statistical methods have been developed to control the family-wise error rate. We'll examine three major approaches: the ≈†id√°k correction, the Bonferroni correction, and Tukey's HSD method.

The ≈†id√°k Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ≈†id√°k correction directly inverts the independence-based FWER formula to find the individual test level needed to achieve a desired overall level.

**Derivation**: If we want :math:`\text{FWER} = \alpha_{\text{overall}}`, we solve:

.. math::

   \alpha_{\text{overall}} = 1 - (1 - \alpha_{\text{single}})^c

Rearranging:

.. math::

   (1 - \alpha_{\text{single}})^c = 1 - \alpha_{\text{overall}}

Taking the :math:`c`-th root:

.. math::

   1 - \alpha_{\text{single}} = (1 - \alpha_{\text{overall}})^{1/c}

Therefore:

.. math::

   \alpha_{\text{single}} = 1 - (1 - \alpha_{\text{overall}})^{1/c}

**Example calculation**: For our coffeehouse study with 5 groups (:math:`c = 10` comparisons) and desired :math:`\alpha_{\text{overall}} = 0.05`:

.. math::

   \alpha_{\text{single}} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^{1/10} = 1 - (0.95)^{0.1} = 1 - 0.994884 = 0.005116

We would use :math:`\alpha = 0.005116` for each individual test, making our critical values much more stringent.

**Verification**: Using this corrected level:

.. math::

   \text{FWER} = 1 - (1 - 0.005116)^{10} = 1 - (0.994884)^{10} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05

**Limitations**: The ≈†id√°k correction assumes complete independence between tests. In practice, pairwise comparisons using the same data and pooled variance estimate are correlated, making this assumption problematic.

The Bonferroni Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bonferroni correction takes a different approach, using an inequality to bound the family-wise error rate rather than assuming independence.

**Mathematical foundation**: The correction relies on Boole's inequality (also called the union bound):

.. math::

   P\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^c A_j\right) \leq \sum_{j=1}^c P(A_j)

Applied to our context:

.. math::

   P\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^c \{\text{Reject } H_0^{(j)}\}\right) \leq \sum_{j=1}^c P(\text{Reject } H_0^{(j)})

If each test uses significance level :math:`\alpha_{\text{single}}`, then under the respective null hypotheses:

.. math::

   \text{FWER} \leq c \times \alpha_{\text{single}}

**The Bonferroni correction**: To ensure :math:`\text{FWER} \leq \alpha_{\text{overall}}`, we set:

.. math::

   \alpha_{\text{single}} = \frac{\alpha_{\text{overall}}}{c}

**Example calculation**: For 10 comparisons with desired :math:`\alpha_{\text{overall}} = 0.05`:

.. math::

   \alpha_{\text{single}} = \frac{0.05}{10} = 0.005

Notice this is slightly more conservative than the ≈†id√°k correction (0.005 vs 0.005116).

**Key advantages**:

- No independence assumption required
- Simple to calculate and apply
- Provides a true upper bound on FWER

**Key disadvantages**:

- More conservative than ≈†id√°k correction
- Can be overly restrictive with many comparisons
- Uses an inequality rather than an equality, potentially wasting statistical power

Why the Inequality Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bonferroni correction uses an upper bound rather than the exact FWER. To see why this creates conservatism, consider the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union of events:

.. math::

   P(A_1 \cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1 \cap A_2)

The Bonferroni bound ignores the negative intersection term :math:`P(A_1 \cap A_2)`, which represents the probability of making Type I errors in multiple tests simultaneously. Since this intersection probability is always non-negative, the bound overestimates the true FWER.

For more than two events, the inclusion-exclusion principle involves alternating sums of increasingly complex intersection terms. The Bonferroni bound uses only the first (positive) terms, making it increasingly conservative as the number of comparisons grows.

Conservative Nature and Power Implications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both ≈†id√°k and Bonferroni corrections are **conservative**‚Äîthey control the FWER at or below the desired level, often well below it. This conservatism comes at the cost of reduced statistical power (increased probability of Type II errors).

When we make the significance level more stringent for each comparison (from 0.05 to 0.005, for example), we make it more difficult to reject individual null hypotheses. This reduces our ability to detect true differences that actually exist in the population.

As the number of comparisons increases, these methods become increasingly restrictive. For example, with 15 groups requiring 105 pairwise comparisons, the Bonferroni correction would use :math:`\alpha_{\text{single}} = 0.05/105 ‚âà 0.0005` for each test‚Äîan extremely stringent criterion that would miss many real differences.

Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) Method
----------------------------------------------------

Tukey's HSD method represents a major advance in multiple comparison procedures. Instead of adjusting individual significance levels, it uses a fundamentally different approach based on the studentized range distribution.

The Philosophy Behind Tukey's HSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tukey's method recognizes that the pairwise comparisons in ANOVA are not independent‚Äîthey all use the same pooled variance estimate (MSE) and involve overlapping group comparisons. Rather than pretending independence or using conservative bounds, Tukey's HSD explicitly accounts for this correlation structure.

The key insight is to control the family-wise error rate by focusing on the **largest** difference among all possible pairwise comparisons. If we can control the probability that the largest difference exceeds a certain threshold when all null hypotheses are true, then we automatically control the FWER for all comparisons.

The Studentized Range Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The theoretical foundation of Tukey's method rests on the **studentized range statistic**. Suppose we have :math:`k` independent sample means :math:`\bar{X}_1, \bar{X}_2, \ldots, \bar{X}_k` from normal populations with common variance :math:`\sigma^2`, each based on sample size :math:`n`. The studentized range statistic is:

.. math::

   Q = \frac{\max_i \bar{X}_i - \min_i \bar{X}_i}{\sqrt{\sigma^2/n}}

When :math:`\sigma^2` is unknown and estimated by :math:`s^2` with :math:`\nu` degrees of freedom:

.. math::

   Q = \frac{\max_i \bar{X}_i - \min_i \bar{X}_i}{\sqrt{s^2/n}}

follows the studentized range distribution with parameters :math:`k` (number of groups) and :math:`\nu` (degrees of freedom for the variance estimate).

Adaptation to Unequal Sample Sizes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In practice, we often have unequal sample sizes. The studentized range distribution theory extends to this case, where for any two groups :math:`i` and :math:`j`:

.. math::

   Q_{ij} = \frac{|\bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_j|}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\text{MSE}\left(\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}\right)}}

The factor :math:`\frac{1}{2}` appears because the studentized range distribution is constructed for the difference between the maximum and minimum of :math:`k` means, which involves a standard error of :math:`\sqrt{\sigma^2/n}`, while the difference between any two specific means has standard error :math:`\sqrt{\sigma^2(1/n_i + 1/n_j)}`. The relationship between these gives rise to the :math:`\frac{1}{2}` factor.

Tukey's HSD Critical Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The critical value for Tukey's HSD is:

.. math::

   t^{**} = \frac{q_{\alpha,k,n-k}}{\sqrt{2}}

where :math:`q_{\alpha,k,n-k}` is the :math:`(1-\alpha)`-quantile of the studentized range distribution with :math:`k` groups and :math:`n-k` degrees of freedom.

The Confidence Interval Formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Tukey HSD confidence interval for the difference :math:`\mu_i - \mu_j` is:

.. math::

   (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_j) \pm \frac{q_{\alpha,k,n-k}}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\text{MSE}\left(\frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}\right)}

This interval simultaneously controls the family-wise confidence level at :math:`1 - \alpha` for all :math:`\binom{k}{2}` pairwise comparisons.

Implementation in R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Method 1: Using confidence level**

.. code-block:: r

   # Get critical value using confidence level
   q_crit <- qtukey(0.95, nmeans = k, df = n-k, lower.tail = TRUE) / sqrt(2)

**Method 2: Using significance level**

.. code-block:: r

   # Get critical value using significance level  
   q_crit <- qtukey(0.05, nmeans = k, df = n-k, lower.tail = FALSE) / sqrt(2)

**Complete procedure with raw data:**

.. code-block:: r

   # Fit ANOVA model
   fit <- aov(response ~ factor, data = dataset)
   
   # Perform Tukey's HSD
   tukey_results <- TukeyHSD(fit, ordered = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
   
   # View results
   tukey_results

**Manual calculation for summary statistics:**

.. code-block:: r

   # Calculate critical value
   q_crit <- qtukey(0.05, nmeans = k, df = n-k, lower.tail = FALSE) / sqrt(2)
   
   # For each pair (i,j)
   diff <- x_bar_i - x_bar_j
   se_diff <- sqrt(MSE * (1/n_i + 1/n_j))
   margin_error <- q_crit * se_diff
   
   # Confidence interval
   ci_lower <- diff - margin_error
   ci_upper <- diff + margin_error

Interpreting Tukey HSD Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A confidence interval that **does not contain 0** indicates a statistically significant difference between those two groups at the family-wise level :math:`\alpha`.

The R output provides several components:

- **diff**: Difference in sample means (:math:`\bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_j`)
- **lwr**: Lower bound of confidence interval
- **upr**: Upper bound of confidence interval  
- **p adj**: Adjusted p-value accounting for multiple comparisons

The adjusted p-values can be compared directly to :math:`\alpha` (e.g., 0.05) to determine significance, or you can examine whether 0 falls within each confidence interval.

Advantages of Tukey's HSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Exact FWER control**: For balanced designs, Tukey's HSD controls the FWER at exactly the specified level (not just an upper bound)

2. **Less conservative**: Generally more powerful than Bonferroni or ≈†id√°k corrections because it accounts for the correlation structure among tests

3. **No independence assumption**: The method is derived specifically for the correlated structure of pairwise comparisons using pooled variance

4. **Optimal for all pairwise comparisons**: When the goal is to compare all possible pairs of groups, Tukey's HSD is typically the most powerful method

Alternative: Dunnett's Method for Control Comparisons
-------------------------------------------------------

When the research design includes a **control group** and the primary interest lies in comparing each treatment to the control (rather than all pairwise comparisons), **Dunnett's method** provides a more powerful alternative.

The Dunnett Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider :math:`k` groups where group 1 is a control and groups 2 through :math:`k` are treatments. Instead of :math:`\binom{k}{2}` pairwise comparisons, we perform only :math:`k-1` comparisons:

.. math::

   \mu_1 \text{ vs } \mu_2, \quad \mu_1 \text{ vs } \mu_3, \quad \ldots, \quad \mu_1 \text{ vs } \mu_k

This reduction in the number of comparisons (from :math:`\binom{k}{2}` to :math:`k-1`) leads to increased statistical power for detecting differences from the control.

Advantages of Dunnett's Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Fewer comparisons**: :math:`k-1` instead of :math:`\binom{k}{2}`, dramatically reducing the multiple comparison penalty

2. **Increased power**: More powerful for detecting treatment-vs-control differences

3. **Targeted inference**: Focuses on the scientifically relevant comparisons when a control group exists

4. **Still controls FWER**: Maintains proper family-wise error control

**Example**: With 5 groups, Tukey's HSD requires 10 comparisons while Dunnett's method requires only 4, leading to substantially less stringent critical values.

Implementation Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dunnett's method is not implemented in base R but is available in various packages. The theoretical development parallels Tukey's approach but uses a different multivariate distribution that accounts for the specific correlation structure among control-vs-treatment comparisons.

.. code-block:: r

   # Example using a hypothetical package
   # install.packages("multcomp")  # or another package
   # library(multcomp)
   # dunnett_results <- dunnett.test(fit, control = "group1")

The exact implementation details vary by package, but the conceptual approach remains the same: use a specialized distribution to set critical values that control the FWER for the specific set of control-vs-treatment comparisons.

Visual Display of Multiple Comparison Results
---------------------------------------------

After obtaining multiple comparison results, creating an effective visual summary helps communicate the pattern of group differences clearly and intuitively.

The Underline Method: Step-by-Step Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard approach uses an "underline" notation to show which groups cannot be distinguished statistically:

1. **Order groups by sample means**: Arrange groups from smallest to largest sample mean

2. **Identify non-significant pairs**: From your multiple comparison results, identify all pairs that are NOT significantly different

3. **Draw underlines for adjacent groups**: Start by drawing lines under groups that are adjacent in your ordering and not significantly different

4. **Extend underlines when possible**: If groups A and B are connected by an underline, and B and C are connected by an underline, and A and C are also not significantly different, extend the line to cover A, B, and C

5. **Interpret the grouping pattern**: Groups connected by the same underline are statistically indistinguishable from each other

Visual Example 1: Simple Grouping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider four groups A, B, C, D with sample means ordered as :math:`\bar{X}_A < \bar{X}_B < \bar{X}_C < \bar{X}_D`.

Suppose Tukey HSD results show:

- A vs B: not significant  
- B vs C: not significant
- C vs D: not significant
- A vs C: significant
- A vs D: significant  
- B vs D: significant

Visual display:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   A ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî B ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî C ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî D
         |_______|
   </pre>

**Interpretation**: Groups A and B form one cluster, groups C and D form another cluster, but these two clusters are significantly different from each other.

Visual Example 2: Complex Overlapping Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the same four groups with different significance results:

- A vs B: not significant
- B vs C: not significant  
- C vs D: not significant
- A vs C: not significant
- A vs D: significant
- B vs D: significant

Visual display:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   A ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî B ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî C ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî D
   </pre>

**Interpretation**: Groups A, B, and C are all statistically indistinguishable from each other, but group D is significantly different from groups A and B (though not from group C).

Visual Example 3: Ambiguous Transitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the results create apparent contradictions that require careful interpretation:

- A vs B: not significant
- B vs C: significant  
- C vs D: not significant
- A vs C: significant
- A vs D: not significant
- B vs D: significant

Visual display:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   A ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî B          C ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî D
   </pre>

**Interpretation**: Groups A and B are similar; groups C and D are similar; but the statistical evidence suggests that A is more similar to D than to C, even though D and C are not significantly different. This illustrates the limitations of interpreting statistical significance as a perfect ordering‚Äîthe underlying population means may have a different relationship than what our sample evidence suggests.

Complete Example: Coffeehouse Analysis Revisited
------------------------------------------------

Let's work through a comprehensive multiple comparison analysis using our coffeehouse customer age data.

Step 1: ANOVA Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our previous ANOVA analysis yielded:

- F-statistic = 22.14 
- p-value ‚âà 0 (highly significant)
- MSE = 99.8
- Error degrees of freedom: :math:`n - k = 200 - 5 = 195`
- Between-groups degrees of freedom: :math:`k - 1 = 4`

**Conclusion**: We have strong evidence that at least one coffeehouse differs in mean customer age. We proceed to multiple comparisons to identify the specific differences.

Step 2: Choosing the Appropriate Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we want to compare all possible pairs of coffeehouses (no natural control group), Tukey's HSD is the appropriate method. We'll use a family-wise confidence level of 95% (:math:`\alpha = 0.05`).

Step 3: Tukey HSD Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: r

   # Assuming we have the fitted ANOVA model
   tukey_results <- TukeyHSD(fit, ordered = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)

The critical value calculation:

.. code-block:: r

   # Manual critical value calculation
   q_crit <- qtukey(0.05, nmeans = 5, df = 195, lower.tail = FALSE) / sqrt(2)
   # q_crit ‚âà 2.83

Step 4: Detailed Results Interpretation

Step 5: Sample Mean Ordering and Visual Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Sample means in ascending order**:

.. math::

   \bar{X}_{CH4} = 26.42 < \bar{X}_{CH5} = 34.07 < \bar{X}_{CH1} = 39.13 < \bar{X}_{CH3} = 40.50 < \bar{X}_{CH2} = 46.66

**Non-significant adjacent and non-adjacent pairs**: 1-5, 3-1

**Visual representation**:

   CH4    CH5 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî CH1 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî CH3    CH2
   </pre>

Step 6: Comprehensive Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Population mean relationships**:

- **Coffeehouse 4** has the youngest customer base, significantly different from all other coffeehouses
- **Coffeehouse 2** has the oldest customer base, significantly different from all other coffeehouses  
- **Coffeehouses 5, 1, and 3** form an intermediate cluster where customers cannot be distinguished by age statistically, though their sample means suggest the ordering CH5 < CH1 < CH3

**Statistical conclusion**: The data suggests that Coffeehouse 4 might be popular with undergraduates (younger customers) while Coffeehouse 2 might attract graduate students and faculty (older customers). Coffeehouses 5, 1, and 3 have overlapping age demographics that cannot be statistically distinguished from each other.

Advanced Topics in Multiple Comparisons
---------------------------------------

Controlling False Discovery Rate (FDR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While family-wise error rate provides strong control over Type I errors, it can be overly conservative when the number of comparisons is large. An alternative approach controls the **false discovery rate (FDR)**‚Äîthe expected proportion of false discoveries among all rejected hypotheses.

The FDR approach is particularly useful in exploratory research where some false positives are acceptable in exchange for increased power to detect true effects. However, for the controlled experimental settings typical in introductory statistics courses, FWER control remains the standard approach.

Simultaneous Confidence Intervals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple comparison methods we've discussed provide **simultaneous confidence intervals**‚Äîsets of intervals that jointly have the specified confidence level. This means we can be 95% confident that **all** intervals simultaneously contain their respective true population differences.

This simultaneity distinguishes these intervals from individual confidence intervals, each of which would have 95% confidence individually but would not maintain 95% confidence when considered together.

Power Considerations in Multiple Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The choice among multiple comparison methods involves a fundamental trade-off between Type I and Type II error control:

**Most conservative** (lowest power): Bonferroni correction
**Moderately conservative**: ≈†id√°k correction  
**Least conservative** (highest power): Tukey's HSD (for all pairwise comparisons)
**Most powerful** (for specific designs): Dunnett's method (for control comparisons)

When planning studies, researchers should consider:

- The number of planned comparisons
- The relative costs of Type I vs Type II errors in their context
- Whether all pairwise comparisons are scientifically meaningful
- The availability of natural control groups

Best Practices for Multiple Comparisons
---------------------------------------

1. **Always perform ANOVA first** as a gatekeeper test
2. **Only proceed with multiple comparisons** if ANOVA is significant
3. **Choose the appropriate method** based on your research design:
   
   - Tukey HSD for all pairwise comparisons
   - Dunnett's method for treatment-vs-control designs

4. **Avoid Bonferroni correction** unless you have specific reasons to use it
5. **Create visual displays** to communicate results clearly
6. **Report both statistical significance and effect sizes**

The Complete ANOVA Workflow
---------------------------

1. **Exploratory analysis**: Side-by-side boxplots, effects plots
2. **Check assumptions**: Independence, normality, equal variances
3. **Perform ANOVA**: Test for any group differences
4. **If ANOVA significant**: Proceed to multiple comparisons
5. **Apply appropriate method**: Usually Tukey HSD
6. **Create visual display**: Show pattern of group differences
7. **Interpret results**: Identify which groups differ and by how much

Bringing It All Together
------------------------------

.. admonition:: Key Takeaways üìù
   :class: important

   1. **Multiple comparisons are essential** after significant ANOVA to identify which specific groups differ, but naive approaches inflate Type I error rates dangerously.

   2. **Family-wise error rate (FWER)** provides the theoretical framework for understanding and controlling the overall probability of making at least one Type I error across all comparisons.

   3. **Bonferroni and ≈†id√°k corrections** control FWER by adjusting individual test significance levels, but they tend to be overly conservative, especially with many comparisons.

   4. **Tukey's HSD method** provides superior power while maintaining exact FWER control by using the studentized range distribution, which accounts for the correlation structure among pairwise comparisons.

   5. **Dunnett's method** offers the most powerful approach when comparing multiple treatments to a single control group by reducing the number of required comparisons.

   6. **Visual displays using underlines** effectively communicate complex patterns of group similarities and differences, though they should be interpreted carefully regarding transitivity.

   7. **The complete ANOVA workflow** integrates exploratory analysis, assumption checking, overall F-testing, and targeted multiple comparisons to provide comprehensive understanding of group differences.

   8. **Method selection matters**: The choice among multiple comparison procedures should align with research questions, study design, and the relative costs of Type I vs Type II errors in the specific context.
