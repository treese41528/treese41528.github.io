Virtual Humans Tutorial
=========================

Welcome to these expanaded course notes for the **Virtual Humans** lecture series.

This material is based on—but not officially affiliated with—the original **Virtual Humans** lecture series from the Max Planck Insitute for Informatics **MPI-INF**.
The original course material was developed by:

- **Prof. Dr. Gerard Pons-Moll** (MPI-INF, University of Tübingen)
- **Xianghui Xie**
- **Yuxuan Xue**
- **Berna Kabadayi**
