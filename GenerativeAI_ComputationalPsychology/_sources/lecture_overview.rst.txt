Learning Path
----------------

This course is designed to provide both theoretical foundations and practical skills. 
For optimal learning:

1. Start with Module 1 to understand the conceptual basis of AI in psychological research
2. Proceed to Module 2 to learn about implementation approaches and privacy considerations
3. Complete the BFITraitTalk_AI tutorial (Lecture 02.4) to gain hands-on experience
4. Explore Module 3 to understand advanced analysis techniques and future possibilities

The combination of theoretical lectures and the hands-on tutorial will provide you with both 
the knowledge and practical skills needed to implement AI-augmented research methods in your 
own psychological studies.
