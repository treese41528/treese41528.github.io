Lecture 01.2 – Survey Design with Large Language Models
===========================================================

Introduction
-----------------

Survey design is both an art and a science. Despite decades of methodological refinement, researchers continue to face challenges in creating surveys that are clear, unbiased, engaging, and psychometrically sound. The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) into this process represents a significant advancement in how we approach survey construction.

This lecture explores how LLMs can enhance the survey design process in psychological research, with particular attention to their role in creating more effective Likert-scale instruments. We examine the traditional challenges of survey design, the specific capabilities LLMs bring to address these challenges, and best practices for human-AI collaboration in developing high-quality psychological measures.

Traditional Challenges in Survey Design
-----------------------------------------

Before exploring AI solutions, it's important to understand the persistent challenges in survey design:

1. **Question Clarity and Ambiguity**: Even experienced researchers sometimes create questions that participants interpret differently than intended. Double-barreled questions, vague language, and ambiguous references can lead to measurement error (Groves et al., 2009).

2. **Response Option Construction**: Creating balanced, comprehensive response scales (particularly for Likert items) requires careful consideration of the number of points, labeling, and anchoring to ensure they capture the full range of opinions (Likert, 1932; DeVellis, 2017).

3. **Leading Questions and Bias**: Survey designers may unconsciously introduce their own biases through question framing that subtly pushes respondents toward certain answers (Krosnick, 1999).

4. **Cultural and Linguistic Inclusivity**: Questions that work well for one population may be confusing or culturally inappropriate for others, limiting generalizability.

5. **Respondent Engagement**: Long, repetitive, or tedious surveys lead to fatigue, satisficing, and poor data quality (Krosnick, 1999).

These challenges have traditionally been addressed through expert review, cognitive interviews, and pilot testing—effective but time-consuming and resource-intensive processes.

How LLMs Can Enhance Survey Design
---------------------------------------

LLMs offer unique capabilities that address many traditional survey design challenges:

**1. Question Generation and Refinement**

LLMs excel at generating multiple phrasings for the same conceptual question. When prompted, these models can:

* Produce draft survey items on a specified topic
* Suggest alternative wordings for existing questions
* Rephrase complex items to improve readability
* Identify and reformulate double-barreled questions

For example, a researcher could prompt an LLM: "Generate five different ways to ask about perceived social support in a Likert-scale format." The model might produce variants ranging from direct ("I have people I can rely on when I need help") to more nuanced formulations ("When facing difficulties, support from others is readily available to me").

This divergent thinking capacity helps researchers explore a broader range of possible items than they might generate alone, potentially identifying more precise or culturally appropriate phrasings.

**2. Response Scale Optimization**

LLMs can assist in developing appropriate response scales by:

* Suggesting balanced response options with clear gradations
* Providing anchoring descriptions for scale points
* Analyzing the linguistic distance between proposed scale points
* Customizing scales for different question types (agreement, frequency, etc.)

A 5-point Likert scale, for instance, might benefit from LLM input on whether the options are perceived as equally spaced psychologically. The model can suggest alternative wording if "Somewhat Agree" and "Agree" don't seem sufficiently distinct to typical respondents.

**3. Bias Detection and Neutrality Enhancement**

One of the most valuable applications of LLMs in survey design is identifying potentially biased language:

* Flagging leading questions or emotionally charged wording
* Suggesting more neutral alternatives
* Identifying questions that make assumptions about respondents
* Detecting subtle linguistic biases that human reviewers might miss

A researcher might submit a draft survey to an LLM with the prompt: "Identify any questions that contain bias, assumptions, or leading language, and suggest neutral alternatives." The AI might flag a question like "How beneficial was the therapy?" as subtly leading (presupposing some benefit) and suggest "How would you rate the effect of the therapy?" as a more neutral alternative.

**4. Cultural and Linguistic Adaptation**

LLMs can help make surveys more inclusive by:

* Suggesting culturally appropriate phrasings for different populations
* Identifying idioms or references that may not translate well
* Adapting questions for different educational levels or backgrounds
* Providing alternatives to Western-centric concepts

This capability is particularly valuable for cross-cultural research, where subtle linguistic and cultural differences can significantly impact measurement (Shrestha et al., 2025).

**5. Engagement Enhancement**

To combat respondent fatigue, LLMs can help:

* Vary question wording to reduce repetitiveness
* Suggest more conversational or engaging phrasing
* Identify potential areas of tedium in long surveys
* Create natural transitions between topics

Early evidence suggests that LLM-drafted questions may sometimes be perceived as more engaging by participants. A 2024 pilot study found that respondents reported higher positive affect (increased happiness, decreased sadness) when completing a ChatGPT-generated questionnaire compared to a traditional human-written one (Zou et al., 2024).

Case Study: AI-Generated vs. Human-Generated Questionnaires
----------------------------------------------------------------

A recent pilot study (Zou et al., 2024) illustrates the potential of LLM-assisted survey design. Researchers compared participant responses to two versions of a questionnaire: one crafted by human experts and another generated by ChatGPT on the same topic. The content covered similar material, but the phrasing and structure differed due to their different origins.

The results were intriguing:

* Participants reported higher positive affect when responding to the AI-generated questionnaire
* Self-reported happiness increased and sadness decreased during the process
* Participants gave favorable evaluations to the ChatGPT-designed survey, indicating that the questions were engaging and understandable

This finding is particularly notable given longstanding concerns about participant engagement in surveys (Krosnick, 1999).

While this was a small-scale pilot, it suggests that LLMs, when guided properly, can create survey questions that are not only semantically sound but potentially more engaging to respondents—perhaps due to variety in wording or a conversational tone that differs from the sometimes stilted language of traditional surveys.

Practical Implementation: Human-AI Collaboration in Survey Design
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The most effective approach to LLM-assisted survey design is collaborative rather than fully automated. Here's a recommended workflow:

1. **Initial Item Brainstorming**:
   - Provide the LLM with context about the construct you wish to measure
   - Request multiple candidate items and response formats
   - Review the generated items for relevance and face validity

2. **Refinement and Critique**:
   - Ask the LLM to evaluate its own suggestions and identify potential issues
   - Prompt for targeted improvements (e.g., "Make these questions more accessible to adolescents")
   - Request alternatives for any problematic items

3. **Expert Review**:
   - Human experts review LLM-generated content for theoretical alignment and construct validity
   - Refine selected items based on domain knowledge
   - Identify any overlooked aspects of the construct

4. **AI-Assisted Testing**:
   - Use the LLM to simulate potential respondent interpretations
   - Identify items that might be misunderstood by specific populations
   - Flag issues that might emerge in different cultural contexts

5. **Pilot Testing**:
   - Collect data from a small human sample to validate the LLM-assisted items
   - Compare psychometric properties with traditional measures
   - Incorporate feedback for final refinement

This iterative process leverages both AI capabilities and human expertise, resulting in surveys that benefit from the strengths of each. The LLM serves as a creative partner and critic, while human judgment ensures theoretical coherence and scientific rigor (Abdurahman et al., 2024).

Optimizing LLM Prompts for Survey Design
---------------------------------------------

The quality of LLM outputs depends significantly on the prompting approach. Here are strategies for effective prompting in survey design contexts:

**1. Provide Clear Context**

Include relevant background information, target population characteristics, and measurement goals:

.. code-block:: text

   "I'm designing a survey to measure math anxiety in high school students (ages 14-18).
   The target population includes students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.
   The goal is to assess anxiety specifically related to test-taking in mathematics."

**2. Request Multiple Alternatives**

Encourage the LLM to generate diverse options to expand your consideration set:

.. code-block:: text

   "Generate 7-10 different Likert-scale items that could measure the construct of
   'perceived autonomy at work'. Provide variety in wording approaches and perspectives."

**3. Specify Format Requirements**

Be explicit about the desired question structure and response options:

.. code-block:: text

   "Create 5 questions to measure social anxiety using a 5-point Likert scale.
   For each question, provide the item text and the specific anchors for the
   five points on the scale (e.g., 1='Not at all characteristic of me',
   5='Extremely characteristic of me')."

**4. Request Self-Critique**

Ask the LLM to evaluate its own outputs for quality and potential issues:

.. code-block:: text

   "For each of the survey questions you generated, identify any potential
   problems with clarity, bias, double-barreled structure, or other issues
   that might affect measurement quality."

**5. Indicate Target Reading Level**

Ensure accessibility for your intended audience:

.. code-block:: text

   "Rephrase these questions to be appropriate for a 6th-grade reading level
   while preserving the core meaning of each item."

**6. Iterative Refinement**

Use follow-up prompts to progressively improve items:

.. code-block:: text

   "Take the first three items you generated and provide variants that are more
   behaviorally focused rather than asking about general attitudes."

By crafting prompts that provide appropriate context and constraints, researchers can guide LLMs to produce high-quality survey content tailored to their specific research needs.

Limitations and Best Practices
----------------------------------

While LLMs offer significant advantages for survey design, several limitations and considerations warrant attention:

**1. Lack of Empirical Grounding**

LLMs don't inherently understand psychometric properties—they generate content based on patterns in their training data, not based on empirical validation (Bisbee et al., 2024):

* LLM-generated items should always undergo standard psychometric evaluation
* Models may produce plausible-sounding but psychologically invalid items
* Human expertise remains essential for theoretical alignment

**2. Domain-Specific Knowledge Gaps**

Despite their broad knowledge, LLMs may lack specialized understanding of particular psychological constructs:

* Provide models with relevant theoretical frameworks when generating items for specialized domains
* Verify that generated items reflect current understanding in the field
* Be particularly cautious with newly emerging or highly specialized constructs

**3. Algorithmic Biases**

LLMs may reproduce or amplify biases present in their training data (Abdurahman et al., 2024):

* Be alert to potential cultural, gender, or other biases in generated items
* Explicitly request evaluation for bias in prompts
* Use diverse human reviewers to identify bias that the LLM might miss

**4. Technical Limitations**

Practical constraints affect how LLMs can be used in survey design:

* Token limitations may restrict the depth of context provided
* Outputs can vary between models and even between sessions with the same model
* Privacy considerations may limit use of proprietary models for sensitive content

Based on these limitations, we recommend the following best practices:

1. Use LLMs as a supplement to, not a replacement for, human expertise
2. Always validate LLM-generated items with traditional methods
3. Document the use of AI assistance in research publications
4. Maintain a human-in-the-loop approach for all critical decisions
5. Use multiple strategies to mitigate potential biases

Case Example: Developing a Likert-Scale Measure of Climate Anxiety
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's examine how the collaborative process might work in practice. Imagine a researcher developing a new scale to measure climate anxiety in young adults:

**Step 1: Initial Prompt to the LLM**

.. code-block:: text

   "I'm developing a Likert-scale measure of climate anxiety for young adults
   (ages 18-25). Please generate 10 potential items that cover different aspects
   of anxiety specifically related to climate change and environmental threats.
   Use a 5-point scale from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree'."

**Step 2: LLM Response**

The LLM might generate items such as:

1. "I worry about how climate change will affect my future quality of life."
2. "News about environmental disasters makes me feel anxious."
3. "I find it difficult to focus on daily tasks when thinking about climate threats."
4. "I experience physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., racing heart, trouble sleeping) when considering the climate crisis."
5. "I feel helpless about humanity's ability to address climate change."

...

**Step 3: Researcher Evaluation and Follow-up Prompt**

The researcher reviews the items, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and follows up:

.. code-block:: text

   "These items are a good start. Could you add more items specifically about
   behavioral impacts of climate anxiety? Also, can you suggest some
   reverse-coded items to balance the scale and check for response bias?"

**Step 4: Refinement and Expert Review**

After several iterations, the researcher selects a pool of items that appear to have good face validity. These are then reviewed by subject matter experts in climate psychology and psychometrics, who suggest further refinements.

**Step 5: Pilot Testing**

The refined scale is administered to a small sample, and item analysis is conducted to examine internal consistency, item-total correlations, and factor structure. Based on these results, items are further refined or eliminated.

**Step 6: Validation**

The final scale is validated against established measures and tested with the target population to establish psychometric properties.

Throughout this process, the LLM serves as a creative assistant and sounding board, but human judgment guides the core scientific decisions.

Conclusion
---------------

Large Language Models offer powerful capabilities that can enhance psychological survey design. By generating diverse item phrasings, identifying potential biases, adapting language for different populations, and creating more engaging formulations, these tools address many traditional challenges in survey construction.

The most effective approach to incorporating LLMs in survey design is collaborative—using AI to expand the scope of what researchers can consider and refine, while maintaining human oversight for theoretical coherence and scientific rigor. This human-AI partnership offers the potential to create survey instruments that are not only psychometrically sound but also more accessible, engaging, and inclusive.

As we continue to explore the applications of generative AI in psychological research, it's important to remember that these tools augment rather than replace expert judgment. The goal is not automation but enhancement—leveraging AI capabilities to extend human creativity and precision in the pursuit of better measurement.

In the next lecture, we will examine another frontier in AI-augmented research: the use of LLMs to generate synthetic respondent data, including both the promising applications and important limitations of this approach.
