Generative AI in Psychological Research
===========================================

This material explores the transformative impact of large language models and other generative AI technologies
on psychological research methods, with a special focus on survey design, data collection, and analysis.
The shift from traditional research methods to AI-augmented approaches represents a significant
paradigm shift in computational psychology. This lecture series examines both the promising
opportunities and ethical challenges of this emerging field.
