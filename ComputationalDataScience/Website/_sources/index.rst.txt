Modern statistics is computational statistics. The elegant formulas of classical theory—derived under assumptions of normality, independence, and large samples—often fail when confronted with real data: messy, high-dimensional, and decidedly non-normal. Yet the core questions remain: How certain should we be? What can we conclude? How might we be wrong?

This course develops the computational methods that answer these questions without relying on fragile assumptions. We replace analytical derivations with simulation, asymptotic approximations with resampling, and conjugate convenience with general-purpose algorithms. The computer becomes not just a calculator but a laboratory for statistical thought experiments.

The intellectual journey moves through four parts. We begin with **foundations**: what probability means, how distributions behave, and how Python's scientific stack turns theory into computation. We then develop **frequentist inference** computationally: Monte Carlo simulation as the engine, maximum likelihood as the estimator, and bootstrap resampling as the uncertainty quantifier. Next, we explore **Bayesian inference**: prior beliefs, posterior updating, and Markov chain Monte Carlo for models too complex for analytical treatment. Finally, we address **large language models in data science**: integrating pre-trained models into analytical workflows for text preprocessing, feature extraction, data annotation, and retrieval-augmented generation—with careful attention to responsible use, reliability, and privacy.

Throughout, we emphasize both rigor and practice. Every method receives mathematical justification—you'll understand *why* these techniques work, not just *how* to call the functions. But every derivation leads to working code. By course end, you'll have built a complete toolkit for modern statistical computation, from foundational simulation through cutting-edge AI integration.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enrollment requires completion of the following with a grade of C- or better:

**Probability** (one of):
  - STAT 41600: Probability (undergraduate)
  - STAT 51600: Basic Probability and Applications (graduate)

**Statistical Inference** (one of):
  - STAT 35000: Introduction to Statistics
  - STAT 35500: Statistics for Data Science
  - STAT 51100: Statistical Methods (graduate)

**Programming** (one of):
  - MA 16290: Integrated Calculus and Linear Algebra II
  - CS 38003: Python Programming


You should be comfortable with: probability axioms and random variables; discrete and continuous distributions (PMFs, PDFs, CDFs); expectation, variance, and covariance; joint, marginal, and conditional distributions; functions and transformations of random variables; moment generating functions (MGFs); the Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem; Bayes' theorem; hypothesis testing and confidence intervals; Python programming with NumPy arrays; and calculus through multiple integrals.

----

Course Structure
----------------

The course divides into four parts, each building on the previous:

**Part I: Foundations of Probability and Computation**

What does probability mean? How do we describe and compute with random variables? Part I establishes the mathematical and philosophical groundwork: Kolmogorov's axioms, frequentist and Bayesian interpretations, probability distributions and their properties, and Python's ecosystem for statistical computing. These foundations support everything that follows.

**Part II: Frequentist Inference**

The frequentist asks: "What would happen if I repeated this procedure many times?" Part II develops this perspective computationally. Monte Carlo simulation provides the engine for approximating expectations and probabilities. Maximum likelihood estimation and generalized linear models provide the parametric toolkit. Bootstrap resampling, the jackknife, and permutation tests provide distribution-free inference when parametric assumptions fail.

**Part III: Bayesian Inference**

The Bayesian asks: "What should I believe given this evidence?" Part III develops posterior inference from prior specification through MCMC computation. We construct models, check their fit, compare alternatives, and extract predictions—all while properly quantifying uncertainty through posterior distributions.

**Part IV: Large Language Models in Data Science**

How can we leverage pre-trained language models to enhance data science workflows? Part IV addresses the practical and responsible integration of LLMs into analytical pipelines. We cover text preprocessing and feature extraction using embeddings, leveraging pre-trained models for data annotation and augmentation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domain-specific applications, and responsible AI practices including prompt engineering, reliability assessment, and privacy considerations.

The course culminates in a **capstone project** where you synthesize these methods to address a substantial data science problem, demonstrating both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skill.

----

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

1. **Apply simulation techniques** including Monte Carlo methods, transformation approaches, and rejection sampling to analyze probabilistic behavior in data science applications

2. **Compare and evaluate frequentist and Bayesian inference** paradigms by examining their theoretical foundations, identifying their strengths and limitations, and explaining their roles in statistical modeling and decision-making

3. **Design, implement, and assess resampling methods** focusing on both nonparametric and parametric forms of the bootstrap to estimate variability, construct confidence intervals, and improve statistical estimates through bias correction techniques

4. **Apply cross-validation principles** to compute model performance metrics, detect overfitting and underfitting, and select models with reliable predictive accuracy using Python libraries

5. **Construct and interpret Bayesian models** including posterior distributions and credible intervals, apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to approximate posteriors, and evaluate the role of prior distributions in Bayesian inference

6. **Utilize large language models** in data science workflows for contextual data augmentation, feature engineering, and integrating structured and unstructured data to enhance predictive models, while addressing challenges of privacy and reliability
