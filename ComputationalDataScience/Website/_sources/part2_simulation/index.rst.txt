Part II: Simulation-Based Methods
=================================

This part covers simulation-based methods including Monte Carlo techniques, random variable 
generation, parametric inference, linear models, and resampling methods. We develop both the 
mathematical theory behind these methods and their practical implementation in Python.

**Topics covered:** Monte Carlo fundamentals and convergence; inverse CDF method and Box-Muller 
transformation; rejection sampling and variance reduction; exponential families and maximum 
likelihood; linear models and generalized linear models; jackknife, bootstrap, and cross-validation; 
parametric bootstrap and bias correction; confidence interval construction and model selection.
