Computational Methods in Data Science
======================================

This course introduces essential computational methods in modern data science, focusing on 
simulation, resampling, Bayesian data analysis, and the utilization of large language models 
(LLMs) in data science workflows. Students will learn foundational simulation techniques, 
such as random variable generation through the inverse cumulative distribution function and 
rejection sampling. The course provides an overview of Frequentist and Bayesian inference, 
highlighting their theoretical foundations and practical applications.

Key resampling methods, including bootstrapping and cross-validation, will be explored as 
tools for assessing variability, constructing confidence intervals, and validating predictive 
models. The course emphasizes the practical and responsible use of computational methods in 
data science pipelines. The course culminates in a capstone project where students will 
synthesize their learning by designing and implementing comprehensive solutions to real-world 
data science problems.
